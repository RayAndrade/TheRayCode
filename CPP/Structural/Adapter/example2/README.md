**Interface1.h**

This defines an abstract class, or an interface, named Interface1. 
It has a pure virtual function Method1() which means any class that inherits from Interface1 must provide an implementation for this method.

```
class Interface1
{
public:
    virtual void Method1() = 0;
};
```

**Object1.h**

Here, you have a class Object1 which inherits from Interface1. It provides an implementation for the Method1() function, though the body of the method is empty. 
This class is a concrete implementation of the Interface1 interface.


```
#include "Interface1.h"

class Object1 : public Interface1
{
public:
    virtual void Method1() override {}
};
```

**Interface2.h**

Similarly, this is another abstract class named Interface2 with a pure virtual function Method2().

```
class Interface2
{
public:
    virtual void Method2() = 0;
};
```

**Object2.h**

This class, Object2, implements the Interface2 by providing an implementation for the Method2() method. Again, the body of the method is empty.

```
#include "Interface2.h"

class Object2 : public Interface2
{
public:
    virtual void Method2() override {}
};
```

**Adapter.h**

Here's where things get a bit more interesting:

The Adapter class is an example of the Adapter design pattern. 
It allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.

This class inherits from Interface1 and accepts an object of type Interface2 in its constructor.
It overrides the Method1() function. When Method1() is called on an Adapter object, it internally calls the Method2() method of the Interface2 object it wraps.
The purpose is to adapt or 'translate' calls from Method1() to Method2().

```
#include "Interface1.h"
#include "Interface2.h"

class Adapter : public Interface1
{
public:
    explicit Adapter(Interface2* o) : obj{ o } {}
    virtual void Method1() override { obj->Method2(); }
private:
    Interface2* obj = nullptr;
};
```

**main.cpp**


You have defined two functions:
**Codebase1(Interface1* obj)** {}: This function accepts a pointer to an Interface1 type. 
It does not do anything with the provided object.
**Codebase2(Interface2* obj)** {}: Similarly, this function accepts a pointer to an Interface2 type and also does nothing with it.

In the main function:
You create an instance of Object2 named obj.
Then, you create an instance of Adapter named adp, passing the address of obj to its constructor. 
This effectively wraps the Object2 instance in an Adapter.
You then call the Codebase1 function, passing the address of the Adapter instance. 
Since Adapter implements Interface1, this is valid.


```
#include <iostream>
#include "Interface1.h"
#include "Interface2.h"
#include "Object2.h"
#include "Adapter.h"

void Codebase1(Interface1* obj) {}

void Codebase2(Interface2* obj) {}

int main() {
    Object2 obj;
    Adapter adp(&obj);
    Codebase1(&adp);
}
```

The essence of this code is to demonstrate how you can use the Adapter design pattern to make classes with differing interfaces work together. 
In this case, you're using the Adapter to 'convert' an Interface2 object into an Interface1 object
