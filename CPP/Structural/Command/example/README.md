Certainly! The Composite design pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Here's a simple demonstration using the concept of graphics, where both shapes (like circles) and groups of shapes are treated uniformly:

1. **Component.h**
    ```cpp
    #pragma once
    #include <iostream>

    // Abstract base class for all components
    class Component {
    public:
        virtual void draw() const = 0; // Render the component
        virtual ~Component() = default;
    };
    ```

2. **Leaf.h**
    ```cpp
    #pragma once
    #include "Component.h"

    // A leaf in the composite pattern. Doesn't have any children
    class Circle : public Component {
    public:
        void draw() const override {
            std::cout << "Drawing a circle" << std::endl;
        }
    };
    ```

3. **Composite.h**
    ```cpp
    #pragma once
    #include "Component.h"
    #include <vector>

    // Composite class that can contain both leafs (Circles) and other composites (Groups)
    class Group : public Component {
    public:
        void add(Component* component) {
            children.push_back(component);
        }

        void draw() const override {
            std::cout << "Drawing a group:" << std::endl;
            for (const auto& child : children) {
                child->draw();
            }
        }

        ~Group() {
            for (auto& child : children) {
                delete child;
            }
        }

    private:
        std::vector<Component*> children;
    };
    ```

4. **main.cpp**
    ```cpp
    #include "Leaf.h"
    #include "Composite.h"

    int main() {
        // Create individual shapes
        Circle* circle1 = new Circle();
        Circle* circle2 = new Circle();

        // Create a group and add individual shapes to it
        Group* group = new Group();
        group->add(circle1);
        group->add(circle2);

        // Draw individual shapes
        circle1->draw();
        circle2->draw();

        // Draw the group
        group->draw();

        // Cleanup
        delete group; // This will also delete the circles inside it

        return 0;
    }
    ```

Explanation:
- **Component.h**: The base class for all graphic objects in our structure. It has a `draw` method that all graphic objects must implement.
- **Leaf.h**: Represents individual shapes (in this example, just circles). They don't have any children.
- **Composite.h**: Represents a group of shapes. It can contain both individual shapes (`Circle` in this example) and other groups (`Group`). It has an `add` method to add components to the group, and its `draw` method will draw all of its children.
- **main.cpp**: A demonstration of creating individual shapes and groups, drawing them individually, and drawing a group as a whole.

When you run the program, you will see that individual circles and groups of circles are treated uniformly. The `Group`'s `draw` method delegates drawing to its children, which can be either individual `Circle` objects or other `Group` objects.
