The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects. This pattern is used to:

* Avoid subclasses of an object creator in the client application, like the factory method pattern does.
* Avoid the inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way (e.g., using the 'new' keyword) when it is prohibitively expensive for a given application.

The pattern involves implementing a prototype interface which tells to create a clone of the current object. This is done by creating a function that uses the clone method to create and return a copy of itself.

Here's how you might implement the prototype pattern in C++.

**Prototype.h**

```cpp
class Prototype {
public:
    virtual ~Prototype(){}
    virtual Prototype* clone() const = 0;
};
```
This is the Prototype base class. It declares a method for cloning itself.

**ConcretePrototype.h**

```cpp
#include "Prototype.h"

class ConcretePrototype : public Prototype {
public:
    ConcretePrototype(int value): value_(value){}
    ConcretePrototype(const ConcretePrototype& other): value_(other.value_){}
    virtual ~ConcretePrototype(){}
    virtual Prototype* clone() const override {
        return new ConcretePrototype(*this);
    }
    int getValue() { return value_; }
private:
    int value_;
};
```

This is a concrete class implementing the Prototype interface. It defines the clone method to return a copy of itself.


**main.cpp**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include "ConcretePrototype.h"

int main() {

    ConcretePrototype original(10);
    ConcretePrototype* copy = static_cast<ConcretePrototype*>(original.clone());

    std::cout << "Original value: " << original.getValue() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Copy value: " << copy->getValue() << std::endl;

    delete copy;
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
