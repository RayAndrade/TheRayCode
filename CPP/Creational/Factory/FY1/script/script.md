The Factory Method pattern is a *creational design pattern* that provides an interface for creating objects in the same superclass. 
It but allows the subclasses to alter the type of classes/objets that will be created.

Starting Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "The Ray Code is AWESOME!!!";
    return 0;
}
```
