The Factory Method is a *creational design pattern* that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass. 
It but allows the subclasses to alter the type of classes/objets that will be created.
We start by creating an *interface* for the toys. This will hold all the toys and they will be of the same type.


Starting Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "The Ray Code is AWESOME!!!";
    return 0;
}
```
