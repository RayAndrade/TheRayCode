Sure, here's an example implementation of the Abstract Factory design pattern in C++ with the theme of toys:

**Toy.h**

```cpp
class Toy {
public:
    virtual void play() = 0;
};
```

**ActionFigure.h**

Which is of type **Toy**

```cpp
class ActionFigure : public Toy {
public:
    void play() override;
};
```

**PlushToy.h**

Which is of type **Toy**

```
class PlushToy : public Toy {
public:
    void play() override;
};
```

**ToyFactory.h**

```cpp
class ToyFactory {
public:
    virtual Toy* createActionFigure() = 0;
    virtual Toy* createPlushToy() = 0;
};
```

Which is of type **ToyFactory**

**SuperheroFactory.h**

```cpp
class SuperheroFactory : public ToyFactory {
public:
    Toy* createActionFigure() override;
    Toy* createPlushToy() override;
};
```

**AnimalFactory.h**

Which is of type **ToyFactory**

```cpp
class AnimalFactory : public ToyFactory {
public:
    Toy* createActionFigure() override;
    Toy* createPlushToy() override;
};
```

**SuperheroActionFigure.h**

Which is of type **ActionFigure**

```cpp
class SuperheroActionFigure : public ActionFigure {
public:
    void play() override;
};
```

**SuperheroPlushToy.h**

Which is of type **PlushToy**

```cpp
class SuperheroPlushToy : public PlushToy {
public:
    void play() override;
};
```

**AnimalActionFigure.h**

Which is of type **ActionFigure**

```cpp
class AnimalActionFigure : public ActionFigure {
public:
    void play() override;
};
```
