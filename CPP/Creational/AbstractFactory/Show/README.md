Sure, here's an example implementation of the Abstract Factory design pattern in C++ with the theme of toys:

**Toy.h**

This is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all toys. It has a single pure virtual method **play()** which must be implemented by all concrete toy classes.

```cpp
class Toy {
public:
    virtual void play() = 0;
};
```

**ActionFigure.h**

This is a concrete class that inherits from Toy and represents a type of toy that is an action figure. It overrides the **play()** method from Toy to provide a specific implementation for an action figure toy.

```cpp
class ActionFigure : public Toy {
public:
    void play() override;
};
```

**PlushToy.h**

This is another concrete class that inherits from Toy and represents a type of toy that is a plush toy. It also overrides the **play()** method from Toy to provide a specific implementation for a plush toy.

```cpp
class PlushToy : public Toy {
public:
    void play() override;
};
```
**ToyFactory.h**

This is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all toy factories. It has two pure virtual methods **createActionFigure()** and **createPlushToy()** that must be implemented by all concrete factory classes. These methods are used to create specific types of toys.

```cpp
class ToyFactory {
public:
    virtual Toy* createActionFigure() = 0;
    virtual Toy* createPlushToy() = 0;
};
```

**SuperheroFactory.h**

This is a concrete class that inherits from ToyFactory and represents a type of factory that creates superhero-themed toys. It overrides the **createActionFigure()** and **createPlushToy()** methods from ToyFactory to provide specific implementations for creating superhero action figure and plush toy objects.

```cpp
class SuperheroFactory : public ToyFactory {
public:
    Toy* createActionFigure() override;
    Toy* createPlushToy() override;
};
```

**AnimalFactory.h**

This is another concrete class that inherits from ToyFactory and represents a type of factory that creates animal-themed toys. It also overrides the **createActionFigure()** and **createPlushToy()** methods from ToyFactory to provide specific implementations for creating animal action figure and plush toy objects.

```cpp
class AnimalFactory : public ToyFactory {
public:
    Toy* createActionFigure() override;
    Toy* createPlushToy() override;
};
```

**SuperheroActionFigure.h**

This is a concrete class that inherits from **ActionFigure** and represents a specific implementation of an action figure toy with a superhero theme. 

It overrides the **play()** method from **ActionFigure** to provide a specific implementation for a superhero action figure toy.

```cpp
class SuperheroActionFigure : public ActionFigure {
public:
    void play() override;
};
```

**SuperheroPlushToy.h**

 This is another concrete class that inherits from **PlushToy** and represents a specific implementation of a plush toy with a superhero theme. It overrides the **play()** method from **PlushToy** to provide a specific implementation for a superhero plush toy.

```cpp
class SuperheroPlushToy : public PlushToy {
public:
    void play() override;
};
```

**AnimalActionFigure.h**

This is a concrete class that inherits from **ActionFigure** and represents a specific implementation of an action figure toy with an animal theme. It overrides the **play()** method from **ActionFigure** to provide a specific implementation for an animal action figure toy.

```cpp
class AnimalActionFigure : public ActionFigure {
public:
    void play() override;
};
```

**AnimalPlushToy.h**

This is another concrete class that inherits from **PlushToy** and represents a specific implementation of a plush toy with an animal theme. It overrides the **play()** method from **PlushToy** to provide a specific implementation for an animal plush toy.

```cpp
class AnimalPlushToy : public PlushToy {
public:
    void play() override;
};
```


And here's the implementation code for the factories:

**SuperheroFactory.cpp**

```cpp
Toy* SuperheroFactory::createActionFigure() {
    return new SuperheroActionFigure();
}

Toy* SuperheroFactory::createPlushToy() {
    return new SuperheroPlushToy();
}
```

**AnimalFactory.cpp**

```cpp
Toy* AnimalFactory::createActionFigure() {
    return new AnimalActionFigure();
}

Toy* AnimalFactory::createPlushToy() {
    return new AnimalPlushToy();
}
```


In summary, the Toy, ActionFigure, and PlushToy classes define the basic structure and interface for all toys, while the ToyFactory, SuperheroFactory, and AnimalFactory classes provide an abstract factory pattern to create different types of toy objects. The concrete implementations of these toy objects are provided by the SuperheroActionFigure, SuperheroPlushToy, AnimalActionFigure, and AnimalPlushToy classes.
