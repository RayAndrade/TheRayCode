I will describe the Abstract Factory Design Pattern with a toy theme and provide the code for each class. 
Keep in mind that due to the text format limitation, I can't create separate files, but I will indicate the file names and you can create them yourself.

create a dot h file called

```
Toy
```

```
class Toy { };
```

```
public:
    virtual ~Toy() {}
    virtual void play() = 0;
```
