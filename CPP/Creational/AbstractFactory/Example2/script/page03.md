**Step 2: Create the Files**

For this project, you'd have the following files:

    **Meal.h**: Contains the abstract base class for the meals.

    **Breakfast.h**, **Lunch.h**, **Dinner.h**, **Dessert.h**: These are concrete classes that inherit from Meal and implement its virtual functions.
    
    **MealFactory.h**: This is the abstract factory base class.
    
    **ConcreteMealFactory**.h: These are concrete factories for each meal type, implementing the abstract factory's methods.
    
    **main.cpp**: This file will demonstrate the use of the factories to create different meals.
