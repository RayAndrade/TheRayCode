**Creational Design Patterns**

The creation design patterns describe a collection of patterns that are designed to create objects. Creational design patterns provide various object creation methods, which will increase the flexibility and reuse of existing code.

The Gang of Four described 5 different design patterns:

**Factory**

The Factory pattern will create an instance of several derived classes. The factory method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating various objects that share a superclass, but allows that subclass to alter the type of objects that will be created. 
Abstract Factory.

I explore this pattern with some c++ code. All the code you can find at TheRayCodeâ€™s github.

**Abstract Factory**
Also known as the factory of factories this pattern allows you to create a family of related objects
