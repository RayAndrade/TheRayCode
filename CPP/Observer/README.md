## Observer pattern c++

The intent of the **Observer** pattern is to let you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing.
Notis that there's a lot of different terms with similar meaning associated with this pattern. 
Just remember that the **Subject** is also called the *Publisher* and the **Observer** is often called the *Subscriber* and vice versa.
Also notice the verbs "observe", "listen" or "track" usually mean the same thing.
```c++
class IObserver {
public:
    virtual ~IObserver(){};
    virtual void Update(const std::string &message_from_subject) = 0;
};
```

```c++
class ISubject {
public:
    virtual ~ISubject(){};
    virtual void Attach(IObserver *observer) = 0;
    virtual void Detach(IObserver *observer) = 0;
    virtual void Notify() = 0;
};
```
The Subject owns some important state and notifies observers when the state  changes.
The subscription management methods are **Attach**, **Detach**, **Notify**, **CreateMessage** and **HowManyObserver**.

Usually, the subscription logic is only a fraction of what a Subject can really do. 
Subjects commonly hold some important business logic, that triggers a notification method whenever something important is about to happen (or after it).

```c++
class Subject : public ISubject {
public:
    virtual ~Subject() {
        std::cout << "Goodbye, I was the Subject.\n";
    }
    void Attach(IObserver *observer) override {
        list_observer_.push_back(observer);
    }
    void Detach(IObserver *observer) override {
        list_observer_.remove(observer);
    }
    void Notify() override {
        std::list<IObserver *>::iterator iterator = list_observer_.begin();
        HowManyObserver();
        while (iterator != list_observer_.end()) {
            (*iterator)->Update(message_);
            ++iterator;
        }
    }
    void CreateMessage(std::string message = "Empty") {
        this->message_ = message;
        Notify();
    }
    void HowManyObserver() {
        std::cout << "There are " << list_observer_.size() << " observers in the list.\n";
    }
    void SomeBusinessLogic() {
        this->message_ = "change message message";
        Notify();
        std::cout << "I'm about to do some thing important\n";
    }
private:
    std::list<IObserver *> list_observer_;
    std::string message_;
};
```

We create an **Observer** class that will be extended with the **IObserver** interface.

```c++
class Observer : public IObserver {
public:
    Observer(Subject &subject) : subject_(subject) {
        this->subject_.Attach(this);
        std::cout << "Hi, I'm the Observer \"" << ++Observer::static_number_ << "\".\n";
        this->number_ = Observer::static_number_;
    }
    virtual ~Observer() {
        std::cout << "Goodbye, I was the Observer \"" << this->number_ << "\".\n";
    }
    void Update(const std::string &message_from_subject) override {
        message_from_subject_ = message_from_subject;
        PrintInfo();
    }
    void RemoveMeFromTheList() {
        subject_.Detach(this);
        std::cout << "Observer \"" << number_ << "\" removed from the list.\n";
    }
    void PrintInfo() {
        std::cout << "Observer \"" << this->number_ << "\": a new message is available --> " << this->message_from_subject_ << "\n";
    }
private:
    std::string message_from_subject_;
    Subject &subject_;
    static int static_number_;
    int number_;
};
```
Now let's build a demo of our project. In the main.cpp where we placed the **main** method.
But we first add some **ClientCode**.
```cpp
int Observer::static_number_ = 0;

void ClientCode() {
    Subject *subject = new Subject;
    Observer *observer1 = new Observer(*subject);
    Observer *observer2 = new Observer(*subject);
    Observer *observer3 = new Observer(*subject);
    Observer *observer4;
    Observer *observer5;

    subject->CreateMessage("Hello World! :D");
    observer3->RemoveMeFromTheList();

    subject->CreateMessage("The weather is hot today! :p");
    observer4 = new Observer(*subject);

    observer2->RemoveMeFromTheList();
    observer5 = new Observer(*subject);

    subject->CreateMessage("My new car is great! ;)");
    observer5->RemoveMeFromTheList();

    observer4->RemoveMeFromTheList();
    observer1->RemoveMeFromTheList();

    delete observer5;
    delete observer4;
    delete observer3;
    delete observer2;
    delete observer1;
    delete subject;
}
```
and the in the main method itself.

```cpp
int main() {
    ClientCode();
    return 0;
}
```

When we compile and run we should get:

```run
Hi, I'm the Observer "1".
Hi, I'm the Observer "2".
Hi, I'm the Observer "3".
There are 3 observers in the list.
Observer "1": a new message is available --> Hello World! :D
Observer "2": a new message is available --> Hello World! :D
Observer "3": a new message is available --> Hello World! :D
Observer "3" removed from the list.
There are 2 observers in the list.
Observer "1": a new message is available --> The weather is hot today! :p
Observer "2": a new message is available --> The weather is hot today! :p
Hi, I'm the Observer "4".
Observer "2" removed from the list.
Hi, I'm the Observer "5".
There are 3 observers in the list.
Observer "1": a new message is available --> My new car is great! ;)
Observer "4": a new message is available --> My new car is great! ;)
Observer "5": a new message is available --> My new car is great! ;)
Observer "5" removed from the list.
Observer "4" removed from the list.
Observer "1" removed from the list.
Goodbye, I was the Observer "5".
Goodbye, I was the Observer "4".
Goodbye, I was the Observer "3".
Goodbye, I was the Observer "2".
Goodbye, I was the Observer "1".
Goodbye, I was the Subject.
```
