We are using Languiage standard C++23

Lication
```cpp
/home/ray/TheRayCode/TheRayCode/CPP/Adapter/Show
```

The Target defines the *domain-specific* interface that will be used by the client.
We begin by creating an object we call **Target**
With focus on a file in the file explorer, right click > C++ header file.
Add to targets checked / Shoe checked

Autogenerated 
```cpp
#ifndef SHOW_TARGET_H
#define SHOW_TARGET_H

#endif //SHOW_TARGET_H
```

Between the targets
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Target {

};
```

We are using **iostream** to print to the consol.

we add the code
```cpp
public:
    virtual ~Target() = default;
    virtual std::string Request() const {
        return "Target: The default target's behavior.";
    }
```

This will return the default behaivor.

Our next *class* we will create will be the **Adaptee**. 

```cpp
 class Adaptee {
 
};
```
The code for this class

```cpp
 public:
    std::string SpecificRequest() const {
        return "!!!EMOSEWA si edoC yaR ehT";
    }

```

So for the **SpecificRequest** we will need to include the
The Adapter will be extended by **Target** which will mean we need ti include the Target.h file.


```cpp
 #include "Target.h"
```

Let's create a class called **Adapter**.



```cpp
 class Adapter {
 
};
```
We will *extend* the  **Adapter** with the **Target** class.

```cpp
  : public Target
```
We need to include the **Target** class.

So also need to import **Target**


So lets **add** a privite varable pointer

```cpp
 private:
    Adaptee *adaptee_;
```

And we add the public **Adapter** constructor

Also incude the **Adaptee**

```cpp
 #include "Adaptee.h"
```

So the adapter passes the sring decoded

```cpp
 public:
    Adapter(Adaptee *adaptee) : adaptee_(adaptee) {}
    std::string Request() const override {
        std::string to_reverse = this->adaptee_->SpecificRequest();
        std::reverse(to_reverse.begin(), to_reverse.end());
        return "Adapter: (TRANSLATED) " + to_reverse;
    }
```
This will return the *translation* of the message.
Let's put this altogether in main


we start with some *client* code
```cpp
 void ClientCode(const Target *target) {
    std::cout << target->Request();
}
```
 because of **std** we include **iostream**.

```cpp
 #include <iostream>
```
The client code looks like

```cpp
 void ClientCode(const Target *target) {
    std::cout << target->Request();
}
```
**Adapter** also cotains/has the Target file included and we will also need the  **Adapter** which also includes to **Target** file , so we
inclue the **Adapter** file

```cpp
 #include "Adapter.h"
```

we will also be using the
```cpp
 #include <algorithm>
```
library


So for our demo

First we take a look at **Target**

```cpp
 std::cout << "Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:\n";
 Target *target = new Target;
 ClientCode(target);
 std::cout << "\n\n";
```

next we setup the **Adaptee**
```cpp
 Adaptee *adaptee = new Adaptee;
 std::cout << "Client: The Adaptee class has a weird interface. See, I don't understand it:\n";
 std::cout << "Adaptee: " << adaptee->SpecificRequest();
 std::cout << "\n\n";
```

And now dmonstrate the **Adapter**

```cpp
 std::cout << "Client: But I can work with it via the Adapter:\n";
 Adapter *adapter = new Adapter(adaptee);
 ClientCode(adapter);
 std::cout << "\n";
```
and let's do some cleanup.

```cpp
 delete target;
 delete adaptee;
 delete adapter;
```

WE now compile and run we should get

```run
Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:
Target: The default target's behavior.

Client: The Adaptee class has a weird interface. See, I don't understand it:
Adaptee: !!!EMOSEWA si edoC yaR ehT
Client: But I can work with it via the Adapter:
Adapter: (TRANSLATED) The Ray Code is AWESOME!!!

```
