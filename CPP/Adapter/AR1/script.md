We are using Languiage standard C++23

Lication
```cpp
/home/ray/TheRayCode/TheRayCode/CPP/Adapter/Show
```

The Target defines the *domain-specific* interface that will be used by the client.
We begin by creating an object we call **Target**
With focus on a file in the file explorer, right click > C++ header file.
Add to targets checked / Shoe checked

Autogenerated 
```cpp
#ifndef SHOW_TARGET_H
#define SHOW_TARGET_H

#endif //SHOW_TARGET_H
```

Between the targets
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Target {

};
```

We are using **iostream** to print to the consol.

we add the code
```cpp
public:
    virtual ~Target() = default;
    virtual std::string Request() const {
        return "Target: The default target's behavior.";
    }
```

This will return the default behaivor.

Our next *class* we will create will be the **Adaptee**. 

```cpp

class Adaptee {
 
};
```
The code for this class

```cpp

public:
    std::string SpecificRequest() const {
        return ".eetpadA eht fo roivaheb laicepS";
    }

```
So for the **SpecificRequest** we will need to include the
```cpp
 #include "Target.h"
```

The Adapter will be extended by **Target** which will mean we need ti include the Target.h file.

```cpp
  : public Target
```

So lets add a privite varable pointer

```cpp
 private:
    Adaptee *adaptee_;
```

And we add the public **Adapter** constructor

```cpp
public:
    Adapter(Adaptee *adaptee) : adaptee_(adaptee) {}
    std::string Request() const override {
        std::string to_reverse = this->adaptee_->SpecificRequest();
        std::reverse(to_reverse.begin(), to_reverse.end());
        return "Adapter: (TRANSLATED) " + to_reverse;
    }
```
This will return the *translation* of the message.
