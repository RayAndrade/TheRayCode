Class Descriptions

    Prototype (Prototype.h):
        Variables: Usually, prototypes don't have specific data. They might contain general attributes relevant to all concrete prototypes.
        Methods: clone() - A pure virtual function for cloning the object.

    ConcretePrototype1 (ConcretePrototype1.h):
        Variables: Specific attributes relevant to this prototype.
        Methods:
            Constructor and copy constructor.
            clone() - Overrides Prototype's clone method to return a new instance of ConcretePrototype1.

    ConcretePrototype2: Similar to ConcretePrototype1 but with its own unique characteristics.

Running the Code

When you run the code, you should see the following:

    The main() function creates an instance of ConcretePrototype1.
    It then uses this instance to clone a new object.
    If you have print statements or specific behavior in the constructors or clone methods, you will see output corresponding to these actions.
    You can expand this with more concrete prototypes or different behaviors in the clone methods to demonstrate the flexibility of the Prototype pattern.

Remember, the Prototype pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where object creation is costly, and you want to avoid the overhead of creating objects from scratch.
