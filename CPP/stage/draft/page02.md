The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that allows the construction of complex objects step by step. 

The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

In our example, let's create a simple Pizza object that requires various ingredients like dough, sauce, and topping. 

We'll have a PizzaBuilder to encapsulate the construction logic for a Pizza object.

First, we'll define the Pizza class that represents the product created by the builder.
