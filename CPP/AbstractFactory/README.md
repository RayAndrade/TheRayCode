# The Ray Code #
In this article we will review the **Abstract Factory** pattern.
This pattern allows us to create a family of classes in which
the subclasses of this *family* can cooperate together.

Let's start by creating a couple of products we call **ProductA** and **ProductB**.

For **ProductA** we have the following code:

Likewise we create a **ProductB** to add to our project.


**Factory**

using C++

We create the progect with the following C++ files. 

This is the order we create them:

**Product**.h

**ConcreteProduct1**.h

**ConcreteProduct2**.h

**Creator**.h

**ConcreteCreator1**.h

**ConcreteCreator2**.h
