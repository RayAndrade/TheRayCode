#The Ray Code

In this article we will review the **Abstract Factory** pattern.
This pattern allows us to create a family of classes in which
the subclasses of this *family* can cooperate together.
In the example I will create have two classes
we call ** and * but first we creat an interface called 
** to
hold these two classes.
