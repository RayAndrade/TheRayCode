The Mediator design pattern is used to reduce coupling between classes by centralizing external communications. It promotes the principle of single responsibility and separation of concerns.

For our superhero theme, let's consider a JusticeLeagueMediator that manages communication between different superheroes.

**Create the classes in the following order**:

1. Superhero (Abstract class for all superheroes)

2. JusticeLeagueMediator (Mediator)

3. Concrete superheroes (e.g., Batman, Superman, WonderWoman)
