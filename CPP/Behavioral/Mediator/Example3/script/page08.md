Explanation:

Both Superman and WonderWoman classes extend the Superhero class. Their constructors set their names and pass the mediator object to the base class.

The send method is used to send a message to other superheroes using the mediator. The mediator ensures the message is broadcast to all members except the sender.

The receive method displays a message that the superhero has received from another member.
