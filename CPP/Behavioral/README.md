**C++ Behavioral design Pattern**

Behavioral design patterns are focused on communication between objects, how they interact and fulfill their roles within a system. Here are the primary Behavioral design patterns:

1. [**Chain of Responsibility**](ChainOfResponsibility/README.md): Decouples request senders from receivers by allowing multiple objects to process the request independently or pass it along the chain.
2. **Command**: Turns a request into a standalone object containing information about the request, making it possible to parameterize objects with different requests, delay request execution, or log them.
3. [**Intepretor**](Intepretor/README.md): Provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions for particular languages.
4. **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
5. **Mediator**: Reduces direct communication between objects by introducing a mediator, which centralizes external communications.
6. **Memento**: Allows for the ability to restore an object to its previous state, which can be beneficial for "undo" capabilities without exposing the essence of its structure.
7. **Observer**: Lets objects notify each other of changes without knowing who those objects are, promoting loose coupling.
8. **State**: Lets an object change its behavior when its state changes.
9. **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
10. **Template Method**: Defines the structure of an algorithm, allowing the steps of this algorithm to be redefined by subclasses.
11. **Visitor**: Lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them.

**How does learning these patterns improve you as a C++ programmer?**

1. **Enhanced Design Skills**: Knowing these patterns provides you with well-established solutions to common problems, so you can avoid "reinventing the wheel." This accelerates the design phase and leads to more efficient and effective solutions.

2. **Clear Communication**: When working in a team, using a commonly known vocabulary of design patterns facilitates clear communication. For instance, saying "Let's use the Observer pattern here" is more concise than explaining the entire concept without naming the pattern.

3. **Optimized Solutions**: Many of these patterns, when implemented correctly, can lead to optimized solutions in terms of both speed and memory in C++, which is crucial given the language's emphasis on performance.

4. **Maintainability**: Patterns often lead to more organized and structured code. Well-structured code is easier to understand, modify, and maintain.

5. **Adaptability**: Behavioral patterns, in particular, focus on interactions and roles of individual objects, ensuring that systems can be more adaptable to change. As requirements evolve, systems built using these patterns can often be more easily extended or modified.

6. **Avoidance of Anti-patterns**: Recognizing and understanding design patterns can also help you recognize and avoid anti-patterns, which are commonly recurring solutions that appear beneficial but can have negative impacts.

7. **Understanding Advanced Concepts**: As you dive deep into patterns, especially in C++, you'll encounter advanced language features, such as polymorphism, templates, and the importance of object composition. This deepens your understanding of C++ as a language.

8. **Reusability**: Patterns can often be abstracted and reused in different parts of a software system or even across multiple projects, leading to faster development cycles.

In conclusion, learning behavioral design patterns and design patterns, in general, equips a C++ developer with a toolbox of proven solutions to common problems, making them more effective and efficient in their design and implementation phases. It enhances their ability to produce robust, scalable, and maintainable software.
