Behavioral Design Patterns focus on algorithms, assignments of responsibilities between objects, and the ways objects communicate. In C++, which is a multiparadigm language with a strong focus on object-oriented programming, these patterns are essential for designing object compositions and the communication between them. 

Here are the strengths and weaknesses of each of the 11 Behavioral Design Patterns when used in C++:

1. **[Chain of Responsibility](ChainOfResponsibility/README.md)**
    - **Strengths**:
        - Decouples the sender from receiver objects, promoting loose coupling.
        - Simplifies your object because it doesn't need to know the chain's structure.
    - **Weaknesses**:
        - Might lead to a performance hit as requests might go unhandled or go through the entire chain unnecessarily.
        - Complexity can increase with longer chains.

2. **[Command](Command/README.md)**
    - **Strengths**:
        - Decouples classes that invoke operations from classes that perform the actual operations.
        - Supports undo/redo operations, which can be useful in scenarios like operations in graphical editors.
    - **Weaknesses**:
        - Can lead to an increased number of classes, with a class for every individual command.

3. **[Interpreter](Interpreter/README.md)**
    - **Strengths**:
        - Offers a way to include language elements in an application to match specific grammar requirements.
        - Useful for defining operations for specialized languages (e.g., SQL, XML).
    - **Weaknesses**:
        - Typically requires a lot of classes, adding to complexity.
        - For complex grammars, a parser generator might be more appropriate than hand-crafting an interpreter.

4. **[Iterator](Iterator/README.md)**
    - **Strengths**:
        - Provides a consistent way to sequentially access elements in a collection without exposing its underlying structure.
        - In C++, the STL (Standard Template Library) heavily utilizes this pattern.
    - **Weaknesses**:
        - Care must be taken to manage and maintain the iterator's state, especially with concurrent modifications.

5. **[Mediator](Mediator/README.md)**
    - **Strengths**:
        - Centralizes external communications, reducing the number of subclassing.
        - Helps in defining how objects interact, promoting single responsibility and reducing coupling.
    - **Weaknesses**:
        - Can evolve into a monolithic class that's challenging to maintain if not appropriately designed.

6. **[Memento](Memento/README.md)**
    - **Strengths**:
        - Offers a way to capture an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
        - Useful for providing undo functionality.
    - **Weaknesses**:
        - Can be expensive in terms of memory if many states need to be saved.

7. **[Observer](Observer/README.md)**
    - **Strengths**:
        - Allows for a dynamic relationship between objects; when one object changes state, all its dependents are updated.
        - Promotes loose coupling as subjects and observers interact, but aren't tightly linked.
    - **Weaknesses**:
        - Notification overhead can impact performance.
        - Care must be taken to prevent infinite loops or cascading updates.

8. **[State](State/README.md)**
    - **Strengths**:
        - Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
        - Leads to cleaner transitions and state-specific behaviors.
    - **Weaknesses**:
        - Can lead to an increased number of classes because each state might require a dedicated class.

9. **[Strategy](Strategy/README.md)**
    - **Strengths**:
        - Offers a way to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate them, and make them interchangeable.
        - Promotes the open/closed principle.
    - **Weaknesses**:
        - Clients must be aware of the different strategies to choose one.

10. **[Template Method](Template/README.md)**
    - **Strengths**:
        - Defines the program skeleton in a method in an algorithm but delays some steps to subclasses.
        - Allows subclasses to redefine certain steps without changing the algorithm's structure.
    - **Weaknesses**:
        - Some clients might be forced to implement interfaces they don't use.

11. **[Visitor](Visitor/README.md)**
    - **Strengths**:
        - Allows adding further operations to objects without modifying them.
        - Provides a mechanism to use operations across different classes.
    - **Weaknesses**:
        - Adding new concrete elements is hard.
        - Can lead to violation of the open/closed principle as it requires modifying the visitor for every new class.

For C++ developers, the choice of design pattern should be based on the specific problem and the design context. Properly applying behavioral patterns can lead to more maintainable, flexible, and organized code. However, unnecessary use or misuse can add complexity and potential performance issues.
