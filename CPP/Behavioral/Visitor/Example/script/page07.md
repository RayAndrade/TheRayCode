**Concrete Visitors**

**Visitor1** and **Visitor2**: These classes implement the Visitor interface. 
They provide concrete implementations for the visit methods (VisitConcreteComponentA and VisitConcreteComponentB). 
When a ComponentA or ComponentB object is visited by these visitors, a specific message is printed to the console, indicating which component and which visitor was involved.
