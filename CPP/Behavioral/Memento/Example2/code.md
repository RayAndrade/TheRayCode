The provided code demonstrates the Memento design pattern in C++. Let's break down the components and their responsibilities:

1. **Memento.H (Memento Interface)**:
    - This is an abstract class that outlines the contract for memento objects.
    - The memento objects should be capable of returning their `name`, `date`, and `state`.

2. **SolverMemento.h**:
    - A concrete class that extends the `Memento` interface.
    - It contains two private member variables: `state_` to hold the state data and `date_` to store the time when the memento was created.
    - It provides an implementation for the abstract methods from the `Memento` class. Additionally, `GetName` uses both the `date_` and a truncated version of `state_` for its return value.

3. **Caretaker.h**:
    - This class is responsible for keeping a list of mementos, and can request the originator to create a new memento or revert its state to a particular memento.
    - The `Backup()` method is responsible for saving the current state of the `Originator` object.
    - The `Undo()` method is used to revert the state of the `Originator` to the last saved state.
    - The `ShowHistory()` method lists all saved mementos.

4. **main.cpp**:
    - The main client code that demonstrates the Memento pattern in action.
    - The `ClientCode` function:
        * Creates an instance of the `Originator` class with a predefined state.
        * Creates a `Caretaker` instance associated with the created `Originator`.
        * Calls the `DoSomething` method of `Originator` and creates backups of its state multiple times.
        * Displays the saved states.
        * Reverts the `Originator` state to previous versions using the `Undo` method of the `Caretaker`.
    - The main function initializes the random seed and runs the `ClientCode` function.

Notably missing from the provided code is the `Originator.h` and its implementation. The `Originator` class typically has methods for creating a memento (usually named something like `Save` or `CreateMemento`) and for restoring its state from a memento (`Restore`).

In summary, the Memento design pattern is about capturing and externalizing an object's internal state so that it can be restored later without violating encapsulation. The pattern uses three main roles: 
1. **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
2. **Memento**: Represents a snapshot of the originator's state.
3. **Caretaker**: Responsible for keeping track of the various states of the originator but does not modify or examine the contents of the mementos.

In your code, the `Originator` would save its internal state in a `SolverMemento` object. The `Caretaker` would maintain a list of these mementos, allowing the system to go back to previous states.

What does this code do that I have added to the end of this prompt written in c++? Explain each class and method: this code should be an example of the Memento design pattern


**Memento.H**

```
#include <iostream>

class Memento {

public:
    virtual std::string GetName() const = 0;
    virtual std::string date() const = 0;
    virtual std::string state() const = 0;

};
```

**SolverMemento.h**

```
#include <ctime>
#include "Memento.h"



class SolverMemento : public Memento {

private:
    std::string state_;
    std::string date_;

public:
    SolverMemento(std::string state) : state_(state) {
        this->state_ = state;
        std::time_t now = std::time(0);
        this->date_ = std::ctime(&now);
    }
    /**
     * The Originator uses this method when restoring its state.
     */
    std::string state() const override {
        return this->state_;
    }
    /**
     * The rest of the methods are used by the Caretaker to display metadata.
     */
    std::string GetName() const override {
        return this->date_ + " / (" + this->state_.substr(0, 9) + "...)";
    }
    std::string date() const override {
        return this->date_;
    }

};
```

**Caretaker.h**

```
Caretaker {

private:
    std::vector<Memento *> mementos_;


    Originator *originator_;

public:
    Caretaker(Originator *originator) : originator_(originator) {
        this->originator_ = originator;
    }

    void Backup() {
        std::cout << "\nCaretaker: Saving Originator's state...\n";
        this->mementos_.push_back(this->originator_->Save());
    }
    void Undo() {
        if (!this->mementos_.size()) {
            return;
        }
        Memento *memento = this->mementos_.back();
        this->mementos_.pop_back();
        std::cout << "Caretaker: Restoring state to: " << memento->GetName() << "\n";
        try {
            this->originator_->Restore(memento);
        } catch (...) {
            this->Undo();
        }
    }
    void ShowHistory() const {
        std::cout << "Caretaker: Here's the list of mementos:\n";
        for (Memento *memento : this->mementos_) {
            std::cout << memento->GetName() << "\n";
        }
    }
};
```

**main.cpp**

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include "Originator.h"
#include "Caretaker.h"


void ClientCode() {
    Originator *originator = new Originator("Super-duper-super-puper-super.");
    Caretaker *caretaker = new Caretaker(originator);
    caretaker->Backup();
    originator->DoSomething();
    caretaker->Backup();
    originator->DoSomething();
    caretaker->Backup();
    originator->DoSomething();
    std::cout << "\n";
    caretaker->ShowHistory();
    std::cout << "\nClient: Now, let's rollback!\n\n";
    caretaker->Undo();
    std::cout << "\nClient: Once more!\n\n";
    caretaker->Undo();

    delete originator;
    delete caretaker;
}

int main() {
    std::srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(std::time(NULL)));
    ClientCode();
    std::cout << "The Ray Code is AWESOME!!!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

```
