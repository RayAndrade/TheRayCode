At **main.cpp**
```
#include "Child.h"

#include "Grandmother.h"

int main() {

    std::cout << "\nSharing a feeling of loss:\n";
    child->shareFeelings("loss");

    return 0;
}
```

When you RUN:
```
Sharing a feeling of loneliness:
Child: I feel lonely too, but I don't know how to help...
Mother: I wish I could help, but I have my own sorrows...
Grandmother: I've seen many things, felt many pains. Come, let's talk...

Sharing a feeling of loss:
Child: I'm just a kid, maybe someone else will understand better...
Mother: I've experienced loss too, but I'm overwhelmed...
Grandmother: I've seen many things, felt many pains. Come, let's talk...
