## ðŸ§± Structural Patterns

**Definition**: Structural patterns focus on **object composition**. They define ways to compose objects to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.

These patterns are about **how classes and objects are composed** to build complex but maintainable systems.

### ðŸ”¸ **Adapter**

> Converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects.

* Used when integrating incompatible interfaces (e.g., wrapping legacy APIs).
* Also known as a **wrapper**.

### ðŸ”¸ **Bridge**

> Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so the two can vary independently.

* Separates high-level logic from platform-specific code.
* Useful in UI frameworks where abstraction (e.g., Shape) and implementation (e.g., SVG, Canvas) are separated.

### ðŸ”¸ **Composite**

> Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

* Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.
* Ideal for recursive structures like menus or file systems.

### ðŸ”¸ **Decorator**

> Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

* An alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
* Enables flexible feature addition without altering code.

### ðŸ”¸  **Facade**

> Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

* Simplifies complex APIs (e.g., hiding multiple subsystems behind one simple interface).
* Useful when clients need a simple entry point.

### ðŸ”¸  **Flyweight**

> Reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.

* Used when many small objects share common data (e.g., game tiles, characters).
* Separates intrinsic from extrinsic data.

### ðŸ”¸  **Proxy**

> Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

* Can control access, cache results, or delay instantiation (lazy initialization, virtual proxy, etc.).
* Acts as a gatekeeper to the real object.
