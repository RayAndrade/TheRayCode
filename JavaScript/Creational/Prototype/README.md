**Java Prototype Design Pattern**

|Pattern|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|  [**Prototype**](README.md) | [**C++**](../../../CPP/Creational/Prototype/README.md) | [**C#**](../../../Csharp/Creational/Prototype/README.md) | [**Java**](../../../Java/Creational/Prototype/README.md) | [**PHP**](../../../PHP/Creational/Prototype/README.md) |

## üß¨ What Is the Prototype Pattern?

### üéØ **In simple terms:**

> The **Prototype** pattern lets you **clone existing objects** instead of creating new ones from scratch.

Rather than saying:

> ‚ÄúBuild me a new object from zero,‚Äù
> you say:
> ‚ÄúGive me a **copy of this one** ‚Äî and I‚Äôll tweak it if needed.‚Äù

It‚Äôs like duplicating a document template or making a copy of your character in a game to save time.

---

## üß© When Should You Use It?

* When creating an object is **expensive** or **complicated**.
* When you want to avoid **duplicating setup logic**.
* When you want new objects to be **based on the configuration of existing ones**.

## üß™ Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're creating **custom avatars** in a game.

You‚Äôve got a base character already set up:

* ‚öîÔ∏è Knight with armor
* üõ°Ô∏è Shield
* üéí Inventory

Rather than building a new avatar from scratch for each player, you **clone the original** and then let the player change the hair, name, or weapon.

You saved time **and reused the setup** ‚Äî this is the Prototype pattern.

## üß† Key Concepts

| Term             | Explanation                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Prototype**    | The original object that can be cloned      |
| **Clone Method** | A method that creates a copy of the object  |
| **Client**       | Code that uses the prototype to make copies |

In JavaScript, this idea is baked into the language ‚Äî **every object has a prototype**, and you can clone using methods like `Object.create()`.

---

## üîÑ What Makes It Different?

Unlike the **Factory Method** or **Builder**:

* The Prototype pattern **doesn‚Äôt construct an object from parts**.
* It **copies an existing, fully-initialized object**, including its structure and behavior.

You‚Äôre saying:

> ‚ÄúThis object works ‚Äî give me another one just like it.‚Äù

## üß† Summary

| Feature   | Description                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**  | Clone objects instead of rebuilding them                            |
| **When**  | You have existing objects that serve as templates                   |
| **Why**   | Saves time, avoids duplicate code, supports dynamic object creation |
| **Bonus** | Built-in support in JavaScript via object prototypes and cloning    |
