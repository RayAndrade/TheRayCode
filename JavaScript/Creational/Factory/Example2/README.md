# 🚚 JavaScript Factory Method Pattern (GoF Page 103 Style)

This project demonstrates the **Factory Method** design pattern in JavaScript, modeled after the **UML on page 103** of the book *"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"* by the Gang of Four (GoF).

We use a **logistics** example to make the pattern concrete and relatable.

## 📘 UML Mapping from GoF (Page 103)

| GoF Element     | Our Example            |
|------------------|------------------------|
| `Product`        | `Transport`            |
| `ConcreteProduct`| `Truck`, `Ship`        |
| `Creator`        | `Logistics`            |
| `ConcreteCreator`| `RoadLogistics`, `SeaLogistics` |

## 🔍 Class Descriptions

### `Product.js`

```javascript
class Transport {
    deliver() {
        throw new Error("Method 'deliver()' must be implemented.");
    }
}
module.exports = Transport;
````

> Abstract product that declares the `deliver()` interface.

---

### `ConcreteProductTruck.js`

```javascript
const Transport = require('./Product');

class Truck extends Transport {
    deliver() {
        console.log("Delivering by land in a box.");
    }
}
module.exports = Truck;
```

> Concrete product that implements `Transport` for land delivery.

---

### `ConcreteProductShip.js`

```javascript
const Transport = require('./Product');

class Ship extends Transport {
    deliver() {
        console.log("Delivering by sea in a container.");
    }
}
module.exports = Ship;
```

> Concrete product that implements `Transport` for sea delivery.

---

### `Creator.js`

```javascript
class Logistics {
    createTransport() {
        throw new Error("Method 'createTransport()' must be implemented.");
    }

    planDelivery() {
        const transport = this.createTransport();
        transport.deliver();
    }
}
module.exports = Logistics;
```

> Abstract creator with a factory method `createTransport()` and a business method `planDelivery()` that uses the product.

---

### `ConcreteCreatorRoad.js`

```javascript
const Logistics = require('./Creator');
const Truck = require('./ConcreteProductTruck');

class RoadLogistics extends Logistics {
    createTransport() {
        return new Truck();
    }
}
module.exports = RoadLogistics;
```

> Concrete creator that produces a `Truck`.

---

### `ConcreteCreatorSea.js`

```javascript
const Logistics = require('./Creator');
const Ship = require('./ConcreteProductShip');

class SeaLogistics extends Logistics {
    createTransport() {
        return new Ship();
    }
}
module.exports = SeaLogistics;
```

> Concrete creator that produces a `Ship`.

---

### `index.js`

```javascript
const RoadLogistics = require('./ConcreteCreatorRoad');
const SeaLogistics = require('./ConcreteCreatorSea');

const roadLogistics = new RoadLogistics();
roadLogistics.planDelivery(); // Delivering by land in a box.

const seaLogistics = new SeaLogistics();
seaLogistics.planDelivery();  // Delivering by sea in a container.
```

> Demo client code that calls `planDelivery()` on two different creators without knowing which product is being used.

---

## 🧪 Output

```bash
Delivering by land in a box.
Delivering by sea in a container.
```

| Pattern Role    | Implementation                  | Description                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product         | `Transport`                     | Declares interface `deliver()`                                    |
| ConcreteProduct | `Truck`, `Ship`                 | Implements `deliver()` for specific types                         |
| Creator         | `Logistics`                     | Declares `createTransport()` and business method `planDelivery()` |
| ConcreteCreator | `RoadLogistics`, `SeaLogistics` | Instantiates and returns specific transport objects               |

## 🛠 Suggested Extensions

* Add `AirLogistics` with `Plane`
* Log timestamps for deliveries
* Use `import/export` with ES6 modules

---

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or copy the files into a project folder.
2. Run the demo:

```bash
node index.js
```

---

## 📚 Reference

* *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*, GoF — Page 103 (Factory Method UML)

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Educational Use

This structure is perfect for teaching college students the essence of **creational patterns**, emphasizing **subclass responsibility** for product instantiation while maintaining a **decoupled client interface**.
