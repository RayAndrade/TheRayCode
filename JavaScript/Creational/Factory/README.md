JavaScript **Factory** Design Pattern

[Example 1](./Example1/README.md) | [Example 2](./Example2/README.md) 

## 🏭 What Is the Factory Method Pattern?

### 🎯 **In simple terms:**

> The **Factory Method** pattern lets a class **delegate the responsibility of object creation** to its subclasses.

Instead of using `new SomeClass()` all over your code, you call a **factory method** that decides **which class** to instantiate. The idea is to **let the subclasses decide** what object to return.

---

## 🧩 When Should You Use It?

* When you need to create objects, but **don’t want to specify the exact class**.
* When you want to allow **flexibility** in which object gets created.
* When you’re building a system where the exact type of product isn’t known until **runtime**.

## 🧪 Real-World Analogy

Imagine a **pizza restaurant** that serves multiple styles of pizza — 🍕 New York, 🍕 Chicago, 🍕 Neapolitan.

You call the **orderPizza()** method. You don’t care how the pizza is made — you just say what style you want.

Behind the scenes, each location (subclass) has its **own way of creating pizzas**.

So:

* You say: “Order a Cheese Pizza”
* The New York branch gives you thin crust
* The Chicago branch gives you deep dish
* But you didn’t have to know **how** they made it

This is the Factory Method at work:
Each branch (subclass) defines **how** the product is created, but you use the same interface to order it.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Term                 | Explanation                                                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product**          | The object being created (e.g., Pizza, Document, Button)                    |
| **Creator**          | A class that declares the factory method, but doesn’t implement it          |
| **Concrete Creator** | A subclass that overrides the factory method and returns a specific product |
| **Client**           | The part of your program that uses the creator to get a product             |

## 🔁 How It Differs from Simple Factories

* **Simple Factory**: Just one method that returns a product, often using a big `switch` or `if` chain. All logic is in one place.
* **Factory Method**: The creation logic is moved into **separate subclasses**, promoting **extensibility**.

Think of it this way:

> Simple Factory = Centralized decision
> Factory Method = Delegated decision (open for extension)

## 🧠 Summary

| Feature   | Description                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**  | Defer object instantiation to subclasses                              |
| **When**  | You want to decouple object creation from usage                       |
| **Why**   | Makes code easier to extend, test, and maintain                       |
| **Bonus** | Eliminates hard-coded class names and `new` keywords from client code |
