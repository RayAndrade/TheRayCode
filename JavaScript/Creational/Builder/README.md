JavaScript **Builder** Design Pattern

[Example 1](./Example1/README.md) | [Example 2](./Example2/README.md) | [Example 3](./Example3/README.md)

## 🧱 What Is the Builder Design Pattern?

### 🎯 **In simple terms:**

> The **Builder** pattern helps you create a complex object **step-by-step**, instead of all at once, and lets you use the same process to build **different versions** of that object.

Think of it like ordering a **custom sandwich** at a deli:

* You don’t want the default "ham-and-cheese" combo.
* You want **control**: the bread, meat, veggies, sauces, maybe toasted?

The **Builder** pattern gives you that control — you “build” the final sandwich one step at a time.

---

## 🧩 When Should You Use It?

* When creating an object involves **lots of optional steps or configurations**.
* When you want to **separate** how an object is built from **what** the object is.
* When you want to **reuse** the same building process for **different outcomes**.

## 🧪 Real-World Analogy

Let’s say you're designing **vacation packages**:

* Some people want **luxury trips** (5-star hotel, spa, limo).
* Others want **budget trips** (hostel, bus ride, guided group tour).
* Some want **custom adventures**.

Rather than stuffing all those options into one huge constructor or a mess of `if/else` logic, you use a **Builder** that knows how to assemble different types of trips, step by step.

Each vacation might need:

* 🏨 Hotel
* 🍽️ Meal Plan
* 🚗 Transport
* 🎟️ Attractions

The **Builder** lets you define **how to assemble** those parts, and the **Director** can reuse that process for different types of vacations.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Term                 | Explanation                                                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product**          | The complex object you’re building (e.g., `Vacation`, `Sandwich`, `House`) |
| **Builder**          | An interface that defines the **steps** to build the product               |
| **Concrete Builder** | A class that implements the builder steps for a specific result            |
| **Director**         | Controls the construction process (e.g., “Build me a luxury vacation”)     |
| **Client**           | The code that uses the Director and Builder to get the finished product    |

## 🧠 Summary

| Feature   | Description                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**  | Build complex objects step-by-step                                    |
| **When**  | You need different variations of an object built in similar ways      |
| **Why**   | Keeps your code clean, readable, and reusable                         |
| **Bonus** | Avoids “constructor telescoping” (tons of parameters in constructors) |


## 🧱 S.W\.O.T. Analysis — Builder Pattern

### ✅ **Strengths**

1. Simplifies the construction of complex objects by breaking it into manageable steps.
2. Allows different variations of an object to be built using the same process.
3. Improves readability by clearly separating what is being built from how it's built.

---

### ❌ **Weaknesses**

1. Introduces extra classes and methods that may seem unnecessary for small objects.
2. Can be misunderstood if the roles of the Director and Builder aren’t clearly explained.
3. May add complexity when only a simple object with few parameters is needed.

---

### 🌱 **Opportunities**

1. Teaches clean object creation techniques for situations with optional or nested parameters.
2. Encourages juniors to think about reusability and object configuration.
3. Prepares developers to work with real-world builders used in frameworks and libraries.

---

### ⚠️ **Threats**

1. Overuse can lead to bloated architecture with too many moving parts.
2. Can mask poor design decisions if used to "hide" messy constructors.
3. Misuse may result in tightly coupled Director–Builder relationships.
