JavaScript **Builder** Design Pattern

## 🧱 What Is the Builder Design Pattern?

### 🎯 **In simple terms:**

> The **Builder** pattern helps you create a complex object **step-by-step**, instead of all at once, and lets you use the same process to build **different versions** of that object.

Think of it like ordering a **custom sandwich** at a deli:

* You don’t want the default "ham-and-cheese" combo.
* You want **control**: the bread, meat, veggies, sauces, maybe toasted?

The **Builder** pattern gives you that control — you “build” the final sandwich one step at a time.

## 🧩 When Should You Use It?

* When creating an object involves **lots of optional steps or configurations**.
* When you want to **separate** how an object is built from **what** the object is.
* When you want to **reuse** the same building process for **different outcomes**.

## 🧪 Real-World Analogy

Let’s say you're designing **vacation packages**:

* Some people want **luxury trips** (5-star hotel, spa, limo).
* Others want **budget trips** (hostel, bus ride, guided group tour).
* Some want **custom adventures**.

Rather than stuffing all those options into one huge constructor or a mess of `if/else` logic, you use a **Builder** that knows how to assemble different types of trips, step by step.

Each vacation might need:

* 🏨 Hotel
* 🍽️ Meal Plan
* 🚗 Transport
* 🎟️ Attractions

The **Builder** lets you define **how to assemble** those parts, and the **Director** can reuse that process for different types of vacations.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Term                 | Explanation                                                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product**          | The complex object you’re building (e.g., `Vacation`, `Sandwich`, `House`) |
| **Builder**          | An interface that defines the **steps** to build the product               |
| **Concrete Builder** | A class that implements the builder steps for a specific result            |
| **Director**         | Controls the construction process (e.g., “Build me a luxury vacation”)     |
| **Client**           | The code that uses the Director and Builder to get the finished product    |

## 🧠 Summary

| Feature   | Description                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**  | Build complex objects step-by-step                                    |
| **When**  | You need different variations of an object built in similar ways      |
| **Why**   | Keeps your code clean, readable, and reusable                         |
| **Bonus** | Avoids “constructor telescoping” (tons of parameters in constructors) |
