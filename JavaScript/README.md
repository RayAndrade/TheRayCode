# Mastering Design Patterns in JavaScript

Welcome to **Mastering Design Patterns in JavaScript**, a beginner-friendly course designed for developers who want to level up their programming skills with real-world software design techniques. In this course, you'll explore the **23 classic design patterns** introduced by the **Gang of Four** and learn how to implement them using JavaScript's **flexible, dynamic, and functional features**.

From working with objects and closures to leveraging ES6+ syntax, youâ€™ll build a solid understanding of how design patterns help you write **cleaner, reusable, and maintainable code** for web apps, APIs, and more.

## ðŸ§  Introduction to Design Patterns

### What Are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are **proven solutions to common coding problems**. They give your code a clear structure and help avoid reinventing the wheel.

### Why Use Design Patterns in JavaScript?
JavaScript is powerful for building both front-end and back-end apps. Using design patterns improves code quality, readability, and collaboration â€” especially as projects grow in size.

## ðŸŽ¯ 1. Creational Patterns

These patterns focus on **how objects are created**, giving you more flexibility and control over your code.

### âœ… Singleton
Ensures a class has **only one instance** and provides a global access point.

**Use Case**: App settings, database connections, or authentication context.

```js
const Singleton = (function () {
  let instance;
  function createInstance() {
    return { id: Math.random() };
  }
  return {
    getInstance: function () {
      if (!instance) instance = createInstance();
      return instance;
    },
  };
})();
