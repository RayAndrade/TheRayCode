# Mastering Design Patterns in JavaScript

Welcome to **Mastering Design Patterns in JavaScript**, a beginner-friendly course designed for developers who want to level up their programming skills with real-world software design techniques. In this course, you'll explore the **23 classic design patterns** introduced by the **Gang of Four** and learn how to implement them using JavaScript's **flexible, dynamic, and functional features**.

From working with objects and closures to leveraging ES6+ syntax, you‚Äôll build a solid understanding of how design patterns help you write **cleaner, reusable, and maintainable code** for web apps, APIs, and more.

## üß† Introduction to Design Patterns

### What Are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are **proven solutions to common coding problems**. They give your code a clear structure and help avoid reinventing the wheel.

### Why Use Design Patterns in JavaScript?
JavaScript is powerful for building both front-end and back-end apps. Using design patterns improves code quality, readability, and collaboration ‚Äî especially as projects grow in size.

---

## üéØ 1. Creational Patterns

These patterns focus on **how objects are created**, giving you more flexibility and control over your code.

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point. Useful for settings, logging, or authentication.
- **Factory Method**: Lets you create objects without knowing exactly which class to use.
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects without specifying their exact classes.
- **Builder**: Helps build complex objects step-by-step with different configurations.
- **Prototype**: Clones objects instead of creating them from scratch, saving time and resources.

**How They Relate**:
- Factory is a simplified Abstract Factory.
- Builder focuses on step-by-step construction.
- Singleton ensures only one instance.
- Prototype is about copying existing objects.

---

## üèó 2. Structural Patterns

These patterns focus on **how classes and objects are structured**, helping you write **modular and scalable** code.

- **Adapter**: Makes two incompatible interfaces work together.
- **Bridge**: Separates logic from implementation so you can change them independently.
- **Composite**: Treats individual objects and groups of objects the same way.
- **Decorator**: Adds new features to an object without changing it.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces memory use by sharing common data between similar objects.
- **Proxy**: Acts as a stand-in or controller for another object.

**How They Relate**:
- Adapter, Bridge, and Facade simplify working with complex or mismatched systems.
- Composite and Decorator improve structure and add flexibility.
- Flyweight and Proxy improve performance and resource use.

---

## ‚öô 3. Behavioral Patterns

These patterns define **how objects interact** and **how responsibilities are shared** in a system.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one deals with it.
- **Command**: Wraps a request into an object, useful for undo, queues, or button actions.
- **Interpreter**: Defines and interprets simple languages or expressions.
- **Iterator**: Lets you loop through elements in a consistent way.
- **Mediator**: Controls communication between objects to reduce direct dependencies.
- **Memento**: Saves and restores the state of an object.
- **Observer**: Notifies many objects when one changes, like in event systems.
- **State**: Changes an object‚Äôs behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Strategy**: Lets you switch between different algorithms or approaches.
- **Template Method**: Defines a base structure for an algorithm but lets you override certain steps.
- **Visitor**: Adds new behavior to objects without changing their structure.

**How They Relate**:
- Observer and Mediator are often used together in UI development.
- Command, Memento, and Chain are useful for handling workflows and undo/redo features.
- State and Strategy focus on changing behaviors or logic flexibly.

## üöÄ Course Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Real-world Examples**: Apply each pattern to JavaScript projects.
- ‚úÖ **Practical Projects**: Work on mini-projects like to-do apps, API clients, and UI components.
- ‚úÖ **Modern JavaScript**: Learn with ES6+ syntax including classes, modules, arrow functions, and more.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Who Should Join?

This course is perfect if you are:

- A **JavaScript developer** ready to improve your code structure,
- Interested in **web apps, APIs, or front-end frameworks**,
- Looking to write **cleaner, reusable, and more maintainable** code...

Then this course is for **you**!

Start today and unlock the power of **JavaScript Design Patterns**.
