# Mastering Design Patterns in JavaScript

Welcome to **Mastering Design Patterns in JavaScript**, a beginner-friendly course designed for developers who want to level up their programming skills with real-world software design techniques. In this course, you'll explore the **23 classic design patterns** introduced by the **Gang of Four** and learn how to implement them using JavaScript's **flexible, dynamic, and functional features**.

From working with objects and closures to leveraging ES6+ syntax, you‚Äôll build a solid understanding of how design patterns help you write **cleaner, reusable, and maintainable code** for web apps, APIs, and more.

---

## üß† Introduction to Design Patterns

### What Are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are **proven solutions to common coding problems**. They give your code a clear structure and help avoid reinventing the wheel.

### Why Use Design Patterns in JavaScript?
JavaScript is powerful for building both front-end and back-end apps. Using design patterns improves code quality, readability, and collaboration ‚Äî especially as projects grow in size.

---

## üéØ 1. Creational Patterns

These patterns focus on **how objects are created**, giving you more flexibility and control over your code.

### ‚úÖ Singleton
Ensures a class has **only one instance** and provides a global access point.

**Use Case**: App settings, database connections, or authentication context.

```js
const Singleton = (function () {
  let instance;
  function createInstance() {
    return { id: Math.random() };
  }
  return {
    getInstance: function () {
      if (!instance) instance = createInstance();
      return instance;
    },
  };
})();
````

---

### ‚úÖ Factory Method

Defines an interface for creating objects but lets **subclasses decide** which class to instantiate.

**Use Case**: Creating different types of UI components or HTTP clients.

---

### ‚úÖ Abstract Factory

Creates families of related objects without knowing their specific classes.

**Use Case**: Theming components (e.g., LightThemeFactory vs DarkThemeFactory).

---

### ‚úÖ Builder

Separates object creation from its structure, especially for **complex or chained configurations**.

**Use Case**: Creating a form step-by-step or building a config object.

---

### ‚úÖ Prototype

Clones an object instead of creating a new one from scratch.

**Use Case**: Copying game entities or configurations.

---

**How They Relate**:

* Factory is a simplified Abstract Factory.
* Builder focuses on step-by-step construction.
* Singleton ensures one instance.
* Prototype is about copying instead of creating from scratch.

---

## üèó 2. Structural Patterns

These patterns focus on **how objects and classes are composed**, helping you write **modular and scalable** code.

### ‚úÖ Adapter

Converts one interface into another. Great for **legacy code** or **third-party APIs**.

```js
class OldAPI {
  request() { return "data"; }
}
class NewAPIAdapter {
  constructor() { this.oldAPI = new OldAPI(); }
  fetch() { return this.oldAPI.request(); }
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Bridge

Separates abstraction from implementation so they can evolve independently.

**Use Case**: Separating UI logic from rendering (DOM, Canvas, WebGL).

---

### ‚úÖ Composite

Treats single objects and groups **uniformly**.

**Use Case**: UI trees (e.g., nested menus or file structures).

---

### ‚úÖ Decorator

Adds behavior **without changing the original object**.

**Use Case**: Logging, access control, or formatting wrappers.

---

### ‚úÖ Facade

Simplifies interaction with **complex systems** using a unified API.

**Use Case**: One interface for many APIs (like a single app controller).

---

### ‚úÖ Flyweight

Shares objects to save memory.

**Use Case**: Rendering thousands of map markers or game objects.

---

### ‚úÖ Proxy

Acts as a placeholder for another object.

**Use Case**: Lazy loading, caching, or access control.

---

**How They Relate**:

* Adapter, Bridge, Facade simplify complex or mismatched systems.
* Composite, Decorator help structure UI trees or feature enhancements.
* Flyweight, Proxy improve performance and control.

---

## ‚öô 3. Behavioral Patterns

These patterns deal with **communication between objects** and define **how responsibilities are distributed**.

### ‚úÖ Chain of Responsibility

Passes a request through a **chain** of handlers.

**Use Case**: Middleware in Express.js.

---

### ‚úÖ Command

Wraps a request in an object, allowing for undo/redo or queuing.

**Use Case**: Button actions or task queues.

---

### ‚úÖ Interpreter

Parses and interprets **custom languages or expressions**.

**Use Case**: Formulas or mini query languages.

---

### ‚úÖ Iterator

Provides a way to access collection elements **one at a time**.

```js
const items = [1, 2, 3];
for (const item of items) {
  console.log(item);
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Mediator

Centralizes communication between objects.

**Use Case**: Chat apps or component communication.

---

### ‚úÖ Memento

Saves and restores object state.

**Use Case**: Undo/redo, form state save.

---

### ‚úÖ Observer

Notifies dependent objects of changes.

**Use Case**: React‚Äôs state system or EventEmitter in Node.js.

---

### ‚úÖ State

Changes behavior depending on internal state.

**Use Case**: Toggle UI modes (e.g., play/pause/stop).

---

### ‚úÖ Strategy

Encapsulates **interchangeable algorithms**.

**Use Case**: Different sorting or validation strategies.

---

### ‚úÖ Template Method

Defines a skeleton with overridable steps.

**Use Case**: Base class behavior with customization points.

---

### ‚úÖ Visitor

Adds operations to object structures **without changing them**.

**Use Case**: Traversing DOM trees or ASTs.

---

**How They Relate**:

* Observer pairs with Mediator for UI communication.
* Command, Memento, Chain work well in undoable workflows.
* State and Strategy deal with behavior management.

---
