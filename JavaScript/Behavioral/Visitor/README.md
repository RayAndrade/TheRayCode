## 🧳 What Is the Visitor Design Pattern?

The **Visitor** pattern is a behavioral pattern that lets you **add new operations to existing object structures** without changing their classes, by moving the new behavior into a separate visitor object.

Think of it like hiring a **tour guide** who visits different places and describes each one differently — the places don’t change, but the guide brings new experiences to them.

---

## 🤔 Why Would I Use It?

* When you need to perform operations across a collection of different objects with varying classes.
* When you want to **separate algorithms** from the objects they operate on.
* When you need to add new operations frequently, without modifying existing classes.

---

## ✅ Benefits of the Visitor Pattern

* Makes it easy to add new operations to existing hierarchies.
* Encourages clean separation between data structures and operations on them.
* Supports extending behavior without modifying existing objects.

---

## 🧩 Summary

The Visitor pattern is about **externalizing operations for multiple objects**:

> “The objects stay the same, but the visitor brings new abilities.”

It helps you add new features while keeping your object structure clean and stable.

## 🧠 S.W\.O.T. Analysis — Visitor Pattern

### ✅ **Strengths**

1. Simplifies adding new operations to stable object hierarchies.
2. Keeps data classes clean and focused on their own responsibilities.
3. Supports type-safe traversal through complex structures.

---

### ❌ **Weaknesses**

1. Can make adding new element classes harder since visitors must be updated.
2. May introduce tight coupling between visitors and the element classes.
3. Requires careful design to avoid breaking the visitor interface.

---

### 🌱 **Opportunities**

1. Helps juniors learn to separate data from behavior cleanly.
2. Encourages scalable designs when adding new features to structured data.
3. Builds skills useful for compilers, interpreters, and reporting tools.

---

### ⚠️ **Threats**

1. Overuse may create complicated, hard-to-follow visitor hierarchies.
2. Improperly coordinated visitors can break element encapsulation.
3. Debugging errors in double-dispatch mechanisms can be tricky for juniors.
