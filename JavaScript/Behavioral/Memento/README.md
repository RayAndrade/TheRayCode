## 🧭 What Is the Mediator Design Pattern?

The **Mediator** pattern is a behavioral pattern that **centralizes communication** between a set of objects, so they don’t talk to each other directly but instead through a mediator.

Think of it like an **air traffic controller** coordinating many airplanes so they don’t collide, instead of the planes all negotiating with each other directly.

---

## 🤔 Why Would I Use It?

* When you have complex communication between many objects that would be tangled if connected directly.
* When you want to **reduce dependencies** among interacting classes.
* When you want to encapsulate communication rules in one place.

---

## ✅ Benefits of the Mediator Pattern

* Reduces **tight coupling** between objects that collaborate.
* Makes communication easier to manage and extend in complex systems.
* Centralizes control logic so you can change workflows without modifying multiple classes.

## 🧩 Summary

The Mediator pattern is about **centralizing how objects interact**:

> “Don’t all yell at each other, just tell the coordinator what you need.”

It helps keep systems clean, manageable, and easy to evolve.

## 🧠 S.W\.O.T. Analysis — Mediator Pattern

### ✅ **Strengths**

1. Simplifies complex communications by routing through a single object.
2. Decouples participants so they don’t have to know about each other.
3. Makes it easier to change or extend communication rules.

---

### ❌ **Weaknesses**

1. The mediator itself can become overly complex or bloated.
2. Adds an extra layer that may feel unnecessary for simple systems.
3. Can hide relationships, making debugging harder if not documented well.

---

### 🌱 **Opportunities**

1. Helps juniors learn the value of centralizing coordination logic.
2. Encourages designs that scale better with more components.
3. Provides insight into patterns like pub/sub or event buses.

---

### ⚠️ **Threats**

1. Overusing a mediator can turn it into a “god object” that knows too much.
2. Misusing the pattern can reduce system clarity instead of improving it.
3. Poorly defined mediator rules can create unpredictable message flows.
