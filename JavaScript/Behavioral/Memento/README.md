JavaScript Memento section


## 🧳 What Is the Memento Design Pattern?

The **Memento** pattern lets you **capture and restore** the *previous state* of an object — **without exposing its internal details**.

It’s like using **Ctrl+Z** (Undo) in a text editor. Behind the scenes, the app **stores snapshots** of your text, and each time you undo, it **restores a previous snapshot**.

### 🧩 Roles in the Pattern:

* **Originator**: The object whose state you want to save and restore.
* **Memento**: A snapshot object that holds the saved state.
* **Caretaker**: The manager that asks the Originator to save or restore state, but **doesn’t look inside** the Memento.

## 📘 Real-World Analogy

Think of a **video game**:

* The game character (Originator) can save its position (Memento).
* A save system (Caretaker) stores all those saves.
* You can reload from a past save without knowing what data was inside it.

---

## 🧠 Where You Might Use It in JavaScript

* **Undo/redo** in a text editor or form.
* Saving canvas state in a **drawing app**.
* Storing game checkpoints or player status.
* Form wizards where users can **go back and forth** between steps.

## 🎓 5 Reasons Why a Novice JavaScript Programmer Should Study the Memento Pattern

1. **Undo/Redo Logic**
   Learn how to **build history systems** for apps with text input, graphics, or choices.

2. **State Encapsulation**
   Teaches you to **protect internal data** from being changed carelessly.

3. **Decouple Save/Restore Logic**
   You learn to **separate concerns**: saving is different from using.

4. **Game Development Ready**
   If you're building games, this pattern is **essential** for checkpoints and saves.

5. **Form and UI Navigation**
   Useful in building **multi-step forms** or wizards with "Back" and "Next" behavior.

## 🧠 Memento Pattern – S.W\.O.T. Analysis (JavaScript)

### 🟩 **Strengths**

1. **Undo Feature**
   Helps implement “Undo” by saving and restoring previous object states.

2. **Encapsulation Safe**
   Keeps internal object details hidden when saving state—no need to expose private properties.

3. **Multiple Snapshots**
   You can store many versions of an object without rewriting its logic.

---

### 🟨 **Weaknesses**

1. **Memory Heavy**
   Saving many states uses lots of memory, especially with large objects.

2. **Complex History**
   Managing long chains of snapshots gets tricky as your app grows.

3. **Deep Copying**
   You must be careful to clone objects properly—shallow copies might break your state.

---

### 🟦 **Opportunities**

1. **Text Editors**
   Perfect for apps like notepads or code editors with “undo” and “redo” functionality.

2. **Form Drafts**
   Useful for saving form drafts in web apps so users can go back if needed.

3. **Game Saves**
   Helps store and restore game progress, player stats, or level checkpoints.

---

### 🟥 **Threats**

1. **Wrong Restore**
   Restoring the wrong memento can cause bugs if state history isn’t managed well.

2. **Version Loss**
   Accidentally deleting or overwriting a memento can destroy important data.

3. **Improper Use**
   Can be misused to patch bad design instead of planning better state management.
