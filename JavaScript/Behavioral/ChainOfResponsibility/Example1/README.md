Perfect â€” letâ€™s build a JavaScript example of the **Chain of Responsibility** pattern as described in the *Design Patterns* GoF book (pages 223â€“232), UML on page 223.

âœ… Participants in the GoF structure:

* **Handler** (defines the interface to handle the request and set successor)
* **ConcreteHandler** (concrete implementation that either handles or forwards the request)
* **Client** (sends requests into the chain)

---

**I will:**
âœ… explain each class *outside* the code block
âœ… fully comment each line inside the code block
âœ… place each class in its own `.js` module
âœ… include a working `index.js` demo
âœ… present everything in a GitHub-style `README.md`

# ðŸ§© Class-by-Class Explanation

---

## ðŸ§© `Handler.js`

**Purpose**
This is the abstract class (in JS, a base class) that declares the `handleRequest()` method and holds the next handler in the chain. It defines the interface for chaining.

```javascript
// Handler.js

// Handler is the base class for handling requests
class Handler {
    constructor() {
        this.successor = null; // next handler in the chain
    }

    // sets the next handler in the chain
    setSuccessor(successor) {
        this.successor = successor;
    }

    // defines the handling interface to override
    handleRequest(request) {
        throw new Error("handleRequest() must be implemented by subclasses.");
    }
}

module.exports = Handler;
```

---

## ðŸ§© `ConcreteHandler1.js`

**Purpose**
One concrete handler that processes requests it understands; otherwise forwards to successor.

```javascript
// ConcreteHandler1.js

const Handler = require('./Handler');

// ConcreteHandler1: handles requests in its range or forwards
class ConcreteHandler1 extends Handler {
    handleRequest(request) {
        // check if request is in range
        if (request >= 0 && request < 10) {
            console.log(`ConcreteHandler1 handled request ${request}`);
        } else if (this.successor) {
            console.log(`ConcreteHandler1 forwards ${request} to successor`);
            this.successor.handleRequest(request);
        }
    }
}

module.exports = ConcreteHandler1;
```

---

## ðŸ§© `ConcreteHandler2.js`

**Purpose**
Another concrete handler in the chain, handling different requests or forwarding.

```javascript
// ConcreteHandler2.js

const Handler = require('./Handler');

// ConcreteHandler2: handles requests in its range or forwards
class ConcreteHandler2 extends Handler {
    handleRequest(request) {
        // check if request is in range
        if (request >= 10 && request < 20) {
            console.log(`ConcreteHandler2 handled request ${request}`);
        } else if (this.successor) {
            console.log(`ConcreteHandler2 forwards ${request} to successor`);
            this.successor.handleRequest(request);
        }
    }
}

module.exports = ConcreteHandler2;
```

---

## ðŸ§© `ConcreteHandler3.js`

**Purpose**
A third handler in the chain, handling requests in its own range.

```javascript
// ConcreteHandler3.js

const Handler = require('./Handler');

// ConcreteHandler3: handles requests in its range or ends the chain
class ConcreteHandler3 extends Handler {
    handleRequest(request) {
        // check if request is in range
        if (request >= 20 && request < 30) {
            console.log(`ConcreteHandler3 handled request ${request}`);
        } else {
            console.log(`ConcreteHandler3: no handler for ${request}`);
        }
    }
}

module.exports = ConcreteHandler3;
```

---

## ðŸ‘¤ `Client.js`

**Purpose**
Configures the chain of handlers and initiates requests.

```javascript
// Client.js

// Client builds the chain of handlers and sends requests
class Client {
    static run() {
        const ConcreteHandler1 = require('./ConcreteHandler1');
        const ConcreteHandler2 = require('./ConcreteHandler2');
        const ConcreteHandler3 = require('./ConcreteHandler3');

        const h1 = new ConcreteHandler1();
        const h2 = new ConcreteHandler2();
        const h3 = new ConcreteHandler3();

        // chain the handlers
        h1.setSuccessor(h2);
        h2.setSuccessor(h3);

        // issue requests
        const requests = [2, 5, 14, 22, 30];

        requests.forEach(request => {
            console.log(`Client: sending request ${request}`);
            h1.handleRequest(request);
        });
    }
}

module.exports = Client;
```

---

## ðŸš€ `index.js`

**Purpose**
Runs the pattern demonstration.

```javascript
// index.js

const Client = require('./Client');

// start the Chain of Responsibility demo
Client.run();
```

---

# âœ… Expected Output

```bash
Client: sending request 2
ConcreteHandler1 handled request 2
Client: sending request 5
ConcreteHandler1 handled request 5
Client: sending request 14
ConcreteHandler1 forwards 14 to successor
ConcreteHandler2 handled request 14
Client: sending request 22
ConcreteHandler1 forwards 22 to successor
ConcreteHandler2 forwards 22 to successor
ConcreteHandler3 handled request 22
Client: sending request 30
ConcreteHandler1 forwards 30 to successor
ConcreteHandler2 forwards 30 to successor
ConcreteHandler3: no handler for 30
```

# ðŸ§  Teaching Notes

âœ… Explain how the chain is **dynamic** (the order or number of handlers can change at runtime)
âœ… Show how each handler either processes or forwards
âœ… Discuss error handling if there is no handler (the chain ends)

---

If youâ€™d like, I can help you extend this with **asynchronous handlers** (for example with Promises) or even show a **middleware** pattern like in Express â€” just say the word! ðŸš€
