## ðŸ§  Behavioral Patterns

**Definition**: Behavioral patterns are concerned with **how objects interact and communicate** with each other.

They help make complex workflows and interactions **more manageable, maintainable, and decoupled**.

### ðŸ”¸ 13. **Chain of Responsibility**

> Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it.

* Decouples sender from receiver.
* Used in logging frameworks, middleware chains.

### ðŸ”¸ 14. **Command**

> Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization, queuing, and undoable operations.

* Ideal for implementing action queues or undo/redo.
* Separates command execution from the object that invokes it.

### ðŸ”¸ 15. **Interpreter**

> Defines a grammar and interprets sentences in the language.

* Used to interpret custom DSLs (e.g., regex, SQL).
* Each rule is represented as a class in the tree.

### ðŸ”¸ 16. **Iterator**

> Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

* Common in collections and custom data structures.
* Helps separate traversal logic from container logic.

### ðŸ”¸ 17. **Mediator**

> Defines an object that centralizes communication between a set of objects.

* Reduces direct dependencies between objects.
* Useful in UI frameworks to decouple widgets.

### ðŸ”¸ **Memento**

> Captures and restores an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.

* Used in undo features (e.g., editor history).
* Stores snapshots of state.

### ðŸ”¸ **Observer**

> Defines a one-to-many dependency so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

* Found in event systems, pub/sub models.
* Decouples publisher from subscriber.

### ðŸ”¸ **State**

> Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

* Behaves like a finite state machine.
* Each state is encapsulated in a class.

### ðŸ”¸ **Strategy**

> Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

* Replaces conditional statements with polymorphism.
* Good for sorting, filtering, or pricing strategies.

### ðŸ”¸ **Template Method**

> Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.

* Promotes code reuse.
* Subclasses override only specific steps.

### ðŸ”¸ **Visitor**

> Lets you define new operations on objects without changing their classes.

* Adds functionality to object structures like trees.
* Good for applying operations to elements in a hierarchy.
