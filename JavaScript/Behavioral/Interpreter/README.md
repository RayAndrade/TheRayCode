[Behavioral patterns](../README.md)

## 🗣️ What Is the Interpreter Design Pattern?

The **Interpreter** pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a **grammar** for a language and uses an interpreter to process and evaluate statements in that language.

Think of it like a **calculator** that understands math expressions — you feed it `"2 + 2"` and it knows how to interpret and solve it.

## 🤔 Why Would I Use It?

* When you need to process **structured input**, like formulas, commands, or languages.
* When you want to implement **simple scripting** or query features inside your app.
* When you have repeatable grammar rules you can model in code.

---

## ✅ Benefits of the Interpreter Pattern

* Makes complex grammar processing more manageable by splitting rules into classes.
* Supports adding new language features by extending rule classes.
* Provides a flexible, scalable way to parse and execute small languages.

## 🧩 Summary

The Interpreter pattern is about **defining and executing rules** for a language in your app:

> “Here’s a dictionary so you can translate sentences you receive.”

It’s perfect for custom scripting, mathematical parsing, or domain-specific languages.

### 🟩 **Strengths**

1. **Readable Rules**
   Makes it easy to define and organize grammar rules as small, reusable classes.

2. **Mini Language**
   Great for building tiny languages like calculators, filters, or scripts inside apps.

3. **Modular Logic**
   Each rule is a class, so logic is neatly separated and easy to test.

---

### 🟨 **Weaknesses**

1. **Too Many Classes**
   Even small grammars require lots of classes, which may feel overwhelming to new coders.

2. **Hard to Scale**
   As grammar grows, managing all expressions and combinations becomes complex.

3. **Performance Issues**
   Recursive structure slows down when parsing large or deeply nested expressions.

---

### 🟦 **Opportunities**

1. **Expression Parsing**
   Lets you build safe and flexible math or command expressions for students or users.

2. **Educational Tools**
   Helps students understand how parsing and evaluation work behind simple languages.

3. **Formulas in Apps**
   Allows users to write formulas or custom filters like “price < 20 and category = ‘books’”.

---

### 🟥 **Threats**

1. **Better Alternatives**
   For big projects, parser generators or interpreters like ANTLR may be more efficient.

2. **Misuse Risk**
   Beginners may misuse it where simpler loops or conditionals would be better.

3. **Recursive Confusion**
   Using trees and recursion can be hard if students aren’t confident in those concepts yet.
