Hi, I'm Ray and this is my code for the project I call The Ray Code.

Hello

A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design in software engineering.

Design Patterns are ways of expressing solid architectures that are reusable, extensible and industry standard. 
The concepts of design patterns are usable and understandable in any language and any environment.


Design patterns are solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. 
They are not finished designs which can be directly transformed into code, instead they are descriptions for how to solve a problem.
Don't confuse a design pattern with architecture. 
these are two different things. 
Architecture is for the entire application, how your application is built, the overall structure.
Design patterns are for the smaller modules you can treat it as design patterns eventually contribute to your architecture.
For example you can have singleton for some specific module you can have observer pattern for some other module. 
You can have facade for some other module which in totality will make the mvvm viper mvc mvp whatever you are dealing with so
architecture is for entire application
and design buttons are for specific
modules don't confuse them.

Why should we use design patterns? 
Design patterns makes your code more manageable.
They make it more scalable easily testable it breaks into the modules many times the issues

Design pattern also helps in communicating with other developers. 

They are important for the interview but i would say that they are even more important after the interview.
