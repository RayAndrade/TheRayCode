# TheRayCode 

Hi, I'm Ray and this is my code for the project I call The Ray Code.

A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design in software engineering.

Design Patterns are ways of expressing solid architectures that are reusable, extensible and industry standard. 
The concepts of design patterns are usable and understandable in any language and any environment.
