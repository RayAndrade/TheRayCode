Absolutely, Ray — here’s your **complete and final system recovery report**, covering the entire journey from the original KDE (DreamQuest) environment to your fully restored and optimized Ubuntu GNOME desktop.

This version is written as a **chronological technical record** you can save for future reference or share if you ever need to reinstall or rebuild your setup.

# 🧾 COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM TRANSITION & RECOVERY REPORT

**User:** Ray Andrade
**System:** DreamQuest OS 1.0 (Aurora, KDE base on Ubuntu Noble)
**Current State:** Ubuntu GNOME Desktop
**Date:** November 2025

---

## 🧩 1. Initial Condition (Pre-Recovery)

* The system originally booted into **KDE Plasma**, using:

  * **Konsole** as the terminal emulator
  * **KWin** as the window manager
  * **SDDM** as the display/login manager

* Symptoms experienced:

  * Windows (especially browsers) would **freeze or stay maximized** with no resize or minimize control.
  * Desktop shortcuts (Alt + F7, Alt + F9) produced no response — indicating **KWin failure**.
  * Text consoles (Ctrl + Alt + F2 / F3) spanned both monitors, confusing the dual-display setup.
  * **KDE Konsole** opened inconsistently or failed to gain focus.
  * User strongly preferred **GNOME Terminal** and the GNOME desktop workflow.

---

## 🧩 2. Diagnostic Findings

* `echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` → **KDE / Plasma**

* Disk analysis via `df -h` showed:

  ```
  /dev/sda2  904G  858G  1.1M 100% /
  ```

  → **System completely full**, leaving no space for updates or configuration changes.

* Home-directory analysis:

  ```
  du -h ~ --max-depth=1
  ```

  revealed:

  * `Videos/` → 773 GB
  * `Downloads/` → 14 GB
  * `.local/` → 24 GB
  * `.cache/` → 4.6 GB

  Most usage came from **recording files and cached data**.

---

## 🧩 3. Transition from KDE to GNOME

**Objective:** Permanently migrate to GNOME to simplify workflow, remove Konsole/KWin problems, and ensure a stable desktop environment.

**Steps performed**

1. Open existing terminal (Konsole).
2. Install full GNOME desktop meta-package:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop -y
   ```

   → Installed GNOME Shell, GDM3 (display manager), GNOME Terminal, and core apps.
3. Set GNOME as default session:

   ```bash
   sudo update-alternatives --config x-session-manager
   ```

   → Selected `/usr/bin/gnome-session`.
4. Rebooted system:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```
5. At login, GDM3 displayed GNOME desktop environment; KDE components no longer launched.

**Outcome**

* GNOME became the default environment.
* KDE Konsole replaced by **GNOME Terminal**.
* Window-management and multi-monitor issues resolved.
* User interface consistent with Ubuntu GNOME (top bar, Activities overview).

## 🧩 4. Disk Cleanup and Space Recovery

**Goal:** Free space for stability and new installations.

**Actions**

```bash
rm -rf ~/Videos/*
rm -rf ~/Downloads/*
sudo apt clean
rm -rf ~/.cache/*
```

**Verification**

```bash
df -h
```

Result:

```
/dev/sda2  904G   69G  790G   8% /
```

✅ Freed ≈ 790 GB of disk space (from 100 % → 8 %).
✅ System speed, updates, and installations fully restored.

---

## 🧩 5. Maintenance Script Created

A reusable script was built for monthly cleanup tasks.

**File:** `~/clean_up.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "🧹 Cleaning apt cache..."
sudo apt clean
sudo apt autoremove -y
echo "🧼 Cleaning user cache..."
rm -rf ~/.cache/*
echo "🧽 Cleaning Downloads and Videos..."
read -p "Delete all files in ~/Downloads and ~/Videos? (y/N) " ans
if [[ "$ans" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
  rm -rf ~/Downloads/* ~/Videos/*
  echo "✅ Done."
else
  echo "❌ Skipped user folders."
fi
df -h
```

**Usage**

```bash
chmod +x ~/clean_up.sh
./clean_up.sh
```

Prompts confirmation before deleting user files.

---

## 🧩 6. Screen Recording Environment

**Original tool:** Kazam (screen recorder).
**Problem:** Non-functional UI, no audio capture on GNOME Wayland.

**Replacement:** **Kooha** (Flatpak) — modern, simple screen recorder compatible with GNOME.

**Installation commands**

```bash
sudo apt install flatpak gnome-software-plugin-flatpak -y
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub io.github.seadve.Kooha
```

**Usage**

```bash
flatpak run io.github.seadve.Kooha
```

**Recording tips**

* 🎤 Enable *Record Microphone* for narration.
* 🔊 Enable *Record Desktop Audio* for system sound.
* 🎞️ Default output folder: `~/Videos/`
* ⚙️ Change destination in Kooha Settings → “Save recordings to…”

✅ Tested and verified working; produces `.webm` files ready for YouTube upload.
