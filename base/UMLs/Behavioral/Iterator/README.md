### **Iterator Pattern (GoF Participants)**

**1. Iterator**
• Defines how to move through a collection one item at a time.
• Provides a way to get the next element without knowing how the collection works inside.
• Think of it like a remote control that lets you go “next” or “previous” without touching the wiring.

**2. ConcreteIterator**
• Keeps track of where you are in the collection.
• Implements the actual steps for moving forward or checking if more items exist.
• It’s like a bookmark that remembers your place while you flip through pages.

**3. Aggregate**
• Declares a way to create an iterator for its items.
• Defines the overall collection structure but not how to walk through it.
• It’s like saying, “Here’s my bookshelf — here’s how you get a helper to browse it.”

**4. ConcreteAggregate**
• Implements the method that returns a specific iterator for the collection.
• Knows the real list or data structure being used.
• It’s the actual bookshelf, ready to hand you the right guide to browse its books.

Would you like me to follow this with the **spoken-friendly Option A pseudocode flow** — a short narration describing how these participants interact (like a story for class)?
