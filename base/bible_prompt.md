Great question — and this shows you’re starting to think like a **template-designer**, not just a user.
When you give me a **chapter** and a **Bible version**, here’s what *else* I may need (or what you may optionally provide) to make every output **consistent, accurate, and exactly the way you want it**.

---

# ✅ **1. How many words per category?**

You often ask for:

* 7 nouns
* 7 adjectives
* 7 verbs

But sometimes a chapter **does not contain 7 adjectives** or **only contains fewer verbs** (especially Psalms or Proverbs in HFA).

So I need to know one of these two rules:

### **A. Should I list fewer if fewer exist? (the safe option)**

Example rule:

> “If you cannot find 7, list as many as exist, and tell me how many you found.”

OR

### **B. Should I combine adjective categories? (the fallback option)**

Example rule:

> “If you can’t find 7 adjectives, use participles acting as adjectives.”

or

> “Use verbal adjectives if needed.”

---

# ✅ **2. Should I avoid certain word types?**

You already said:

* **No proper names**

Here are optional filters you can choose:

* exclude **pronouns**
* exclude **possessive adjectives** like *my/your/his*
* exclude **compound words**
* exclude **verbs that repeat in different forms**
* exclude **poetic repeats** (common in Psalms)

If you want simplicity, you can tell me:

> “Include all valid words except proper names.”

---

# ✅ **3. Do you prefer all words in the order they appear in the chapter?**

Right now I am giving:

* words ordered by appearance

Let me know if you want:

* alphabetical
* grouped by verse
* strongest words first (semantic emphasis)

Default is: **order of appearance**.

---

# ✅ **4. Do you want the grammar rules to always be the same two rules?**

Right now I give:

* Verb agreement
* Adjective agreement

If you want variety, say:

> “Rotate grammar rules each time.”
> — OR —
> “Use grammar rules that appear in the chapter.”

Let me know your preference.

---

# ✅ **5. Translation of grammar rules**

You requested:

* Grammar rule in Portuguese/German/etc.
* English translation of the grammar rule
* Example quotes from the chapter

This is now part of the template, unless you say otherwise.

---

# ✅ **6. Summary length**

Tell me your preference:

* **short** (3 sentences)
* **medium** (1 paragraph)
* **long** (detailed paragraph)

Default I use: **medium paragraph**.

---

# ✅ **7. Table column order**

You have already set the rule:

**word | English | type | verse | example**

I will keep this as your standard unless you change it.

---

# ⭐ **RECOMMENDED MINIMAL PARAMETERS (what *you* need to type)**

If you want the simplest, clearest input, you can just give:

> **“Do [BOOK] [CHAPTER] [VERSION] — 7 words each category, notify if fewer exist.”**

For example:

> **Do Salmos 145 ARA — 7 words each category; notify if category has fewer than 7.**

I will handle everything else automatically.

---

# ⭐ If you want, I can build a “master template” sentence for you to copy-paste every time.

Would you like me to prepare a **perfect reusable command template** based on your preferences?
