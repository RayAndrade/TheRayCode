Eating healthily on a fixed income is possible, though it may require some careful planning and prioritization. Here's a guide to help you achieve a balanced and nutritious diet:

1. **Set a Budget**: Know how much you're willing and able to spend on groceries each week or month. 

2. **Plan Ahead**: 
   - Make a weekly meal plan.
   - List out ingredients for each meal.
   - Shop with a list and stick to it.

3. **Shop Smart**:
   - Buy in bulk when possible. Things like grains, lentils, beans, and rice are often cheaper in bulk.
   - Purchase seasonal and local produce. They're often less expensive and fresher.
   - Consider frozen fruits and vegetables, which can be just as nutritious as fresh and sometimes cheaper.
   - Look for sales, discounts, and coupons.

4. **Limit Processed Foods**: These can be more expensive and less healthy. Focus on whole foods.

5. **Staple Foods to Consider**:
   - **Proteins**: Lentils, beans, chickpeas, tofu, eggs, canned sardines or tuna.
   - **Grains**: Brown rice, quinoa, barley, whole grain pasta, oats.
   - **Vegetables**: Buy a mix of fresh, frozen, or canned (without added salt/sugar).
   - **Fruits**: Again, consider a mix of fresh, frozen, or canned (in their own juice, not syrup).
   - **Dairy or Alternatives**: Milk, yogurt, cheese (or plant-based alternatives like almond or soy milk).

6. **Prepare Meals at Home**: Cooking at home is usually more affordable and healthier than eating out. 

7. **Limit Waste**:
   - Use leftovers for the next day's lunch or dinner.
   - Freeze perishables that you can't use in time.
   - Use every part of the food (e.g., make broth from vegetable scraps and bones).

8. **Stay Hydrated with Water**: It's the best drink for staying hydrated and it's free. Avoid sugary drinks or sodas as they can be expensive and not beneficial for your health.

9. **Be Flexible**: If you find a good deal on a certain vegetable, fruit, or protein, be ready to adjust your meal plan.

10. **Grow Your Own**: If you have space, even a small balcony, consider growing some of your own herbs, vegetables, or fruits. It can be cost-effective and there's nothing like eating something you've grown yourself.

11. **Educate Yourself on Nutrition**: Understanding the basics can help you make wise choices. For example, know that you need a mix of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs in every meal. Also, ensure you're getting adequate vitamins and minerals.

12. **Stay Active**: You mentioned you walk 4 miles each day, which is great. Keeping active will help with your overall health and metabolism.

Lastly, don't forget to consult with a nutritionist or dietitian if you can. They might be able to provide personalized advice and help you make the most out of your budget. Remember that investing in your nutrition now can lead to savings in healthcare costs in the long run.
