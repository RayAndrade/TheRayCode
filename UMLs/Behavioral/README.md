Behavioral design patterns are a subset of design patterns that deal with object collaboration and the delegation of responsibilities among objects. They are concerned with communication between objects, leading to a flow or behavior within a system.

Here are the primary Behavioral design patterns and characteristics of their UML diagrams:

1. **Chain of Responsibility:** 
    - Lets you pass requests along a chain of potential handlers until an object handles it or the end of the chain is reached.
    - UML Characteristics: A sequence of handler objects connected in a linear fashion.

2. **Command:**
    - Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queueing of requests, and logging the operations.
    - UML Characteristics: Separate Command objects and a Receiver. The Command declares an interface for executing an operation, and the ConcreteCommand defines a binding between the Receiver and an action.

3. **Interpreter:** 
    - Provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions for particular languages.
    - UML Characteristics: AbstractExpression, TerminalExpression, and NonterminalExpression classes. Client builds the abstract syntax tree using these and then interprets it.

4. **Iterator:**
    - Provides a way to access the elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation.
    - UML Characteristics: Iterator and Aggregate interfaces. ConcreteIterator implements the Iterator and keeps track of the current position in the traversal of the aggregate.

5. **Mediator:**
    - Reduces the direct communication between objects by centralizing external communications.
    - UML Characteristics: A central Mediator object and multiple Colleague classes. Colleagues communicate with the Mediator, and not directly with each other.

6. **Memento:**
    - Captures and restores an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
    - UML Characteristics: Three primary classes: Originator (creates a memento containing a snapshot of its current internal state), Memento (the passive object that holds the state of the originator), and Caretaker (keeps track of various states).

7. **Observer:**
    - Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes its state, all its dependents are notified.
    - UML Characteristics: Subject (or Observable) and Observer interfaces. ConcreteSubjects maintain a list of observers and notify them of any state changes.

8. **State:**
    - Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
    - UML Characteristics: Context class that holds an instance of a ConcreteState subclass. State base class and its derived classes define behavior associated with a state of the Context.

9. **Strategy:**
    - Defines a set of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
    - UML Characteristics: Strategy interface and multiple ConcreteStrategy classes. Context uses the Strategy interface to call the algorithm defined by a ConcreteStrategy.

10. **Template Method:**
    - Defines the program skeleton in an algorithm in a method but delays some steps to subclasses.
    - UML Characteristics: AbstractClass with a template method and steps. ConcreteClass implements the deferred steps.

11. **Visitor:**
    - Adds further operations to objects without having to modify them.
    - UML Characteristics: Visitor interface declaring a visit operation for each type of ConcreteElement in the object structure. ConcreteVisitors implement each operation on every type of ConcreteElement.

The UML diagrams of these patterns usually depict their key players and relationships. In terms of behavioral patterns, UML diagrams often emphasize the flow of control and responsibility between objects, illustrating how they collaborate to achieve a particular behavior.
