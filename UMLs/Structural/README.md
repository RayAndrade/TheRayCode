Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures. The structural patterns ensure that the components of a system are properly structured, ensuring efficient and organized relationships.

Here are the primary Structural design patterns and the characteristics of their UML diagrams:

1. **Adapter (also known as Wrapper):**
    - Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a middle-ground.
    - UML Characteristics: Two distinct interfaces (Target and Adaptee). The Adapter class implements the Target interface and aggregates or inherits the Adaptee to connect the two different interfaces.

2. **Bridge:**
    - Separates an object's abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently.
    - UML Characteristics: Abstraction and Implementor interfaces. RefinedAbstraction extends Abstraction. ConcreteImplementor implements Implementor. Abstraction contains a reference to Implementor.

3. **Composite:**
    - Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
    - UML Characteristics: Component interface with Leaf and Composite classes. Leaf represents individual objects, and Composite holds a collection of Components.

4. **Decorator:**
    - Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
    - UML Characteristics: Component interface, ConcreteComponent class, and a Decorator class that aggregates the Component. Specific decorators extend the Decorator class.

5. **Facade:**
    - Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making the subsystem easier to use.
    - UML Characteristics: Facade class that provides simple methods which delegate to classes in the subsystem. Subsystem classes are often hidden from clients by the Facade.

6. **Flyweight:**
    - Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing them.
    - UML Characteristics: Flyweight interface with ConcreteFlyweight and UnsharedConcreteFlyweight classes. A FlyweightFactory class provides a way to create or get flyweight objects.

7. **Proxy:**
    - Acts as an interface to another object, controlling access to it.
    - UML Characteristics: Subject interface with RealSubject and Proxy classes. Proxy holds a reference to RealSubject and can control access to it.

For these patterns, UML diagrams primarily emphasize the relationships between components, showcasing how smaller parts can be combined to build more complex structures. The relationships (e.g., aggregation, composition, association) and hierarchies (e.g., inheritance) are central to the visual representation of these patterns.
