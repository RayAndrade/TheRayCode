**PHP Factory Design Pattern**

[Show](./script/page01.md)

The **Factory Design Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In other words, it defines a way for creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

Let's demonstrate the Factory Design Pattern using a PHP example. Suppose we have a website that sells different types of *vehicles*, such as cars, motorcycles, and bicycles. We can create a **Vehicle** *interface*, and then create separate classes for each type of vehicle, such as **Car**, **Motorcycle**, and **Bicycle**, that implement this interface.

Here is the *interface* for **Vehicle**.
```
interface Vehicle
{
    public function drive();
}
```
