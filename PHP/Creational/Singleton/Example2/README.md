The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point to access it. Here's how you can implement the Singleton pattern in PHP, spreading the classes across different files.

1. Create a file named `Singleton.php` that will contain the Singleton class:

```php
<?php
// Singleton.php

class Singleton {
    private static $instance;

    private function __construct() {
        // private to prevent instance creation
    }

    public static function getInstance() {
        if (null === static::$instance) {
            static::$instance = new static();
        }

        return static::$instance;
    }

    public function someMethod() {
        return "I'm a singleton!";
    }

    private function __clone() {
        // prevent cloning
    }

    private function __wakeup() {
        // prevent unserializing
    }
}
?>
```

2. Now create the `index.php` file, which will be the entry point for the application. This file will include the `Singleton.php` file and demonstrate the use of the Singleton class:

```php
<?php
// index.php

include_once 'Singleton.php';

$instance1 = Singleton::getInstance();
$instance2 = Singleton::getInstance();

if ($instance1 === $instance2) {
    echo "Both instances are the same.\n";
    echo $instance1->someMethod(); // Output: I'm a singleton!
}
?>
```

When you run the `index.php` file, you will see the output indicating that both instances are the same, meaning that the Singleton pattern has been successfully implemented.

Keep in mind that the Singleton pattern is sometimes considered an anti-pattern because it can make code more difficult to test and can introduce global state into an application. Consider carefully whether it's the best solution for your particular use case.
