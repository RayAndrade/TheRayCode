## Command pattern php

Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. 
This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

This example illustrates the structure of the Command design pattern and focuses on the following questions:
<ul>
<li>What classes does it consist of?</li>
<li>What roles do these classes play?</li>
<li>In what way the elements of the pattern are related?</li>
</ul>



```php
interface Command
{
    public function execute(): void;
}
```
