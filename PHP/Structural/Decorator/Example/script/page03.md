- **Key Aspects:**
      - The `operation` method returns the string "Plain Coffee".
    - **Role:** This class gives us the primary object which will be wrapped by one or more decorators.

Next we make the *class* **ConcreteComponent**.

```
ConcreteComponent
```

It represents the basic object that we'll be decorating. In this case, it's our plain coffee.

```
 implements Component
```
and we add code

```
return "Plain Coffee";
```
