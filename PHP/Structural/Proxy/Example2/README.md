Teaching design patterns is a great way to instill in students the importance of writing maintainable, scalable, and robust code. The Proxy design pattern is particularly useful as it allows for the creation of objects which serve as intermediaries between a client and actual services objects. They can be used for adding security access, logging, or even simplifying the API of complex systems among other things.

In this example, we'll demonstrate the Proxy pattern by creating a simple application that fetches user information. The proxy will be used to control access to this user information, only allowing access if a specific condition is met (e.g., a "secret token" is provided). 

First, let's design our classes:

1. `User.php` - This class will represent a simple user object.

```php
<?php
// User.php
class User {
    private string $name;

    public function __construct(string $name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function getName(): string {
        return $this->name;
    }
}
?>
```

Here, `User` is a simple class with a private variable `$name`, a constructor to set that name, and a getter method `getName()` to retrieve the user's name.

2. `UserFetcherInterface.php` - This interface will define a standard function to fetch user data.

```php
<?php
// UserFetcherInterface.php
interface UserFetcherInterface {
    public function fetchUser(): User;
}
?>
```

This interface ensures that any user fetcher must have a `fetchUser` method.

3. `UserFetcher.php` - This class will implement `UserFetcherInterface` and it's responsible for getting user data (possibly from a database, web service, etc., but we'll use a static user for simplicity).

```php
<?php
// UserFetcher.php
require_once 'User.php';
require_once 'UserFetcherInterface.php';

class UserFetcher implements UserFetcherInterface {
    public function fetchUser(): User {
        // Here you would have your logic to fetch the user data, e.g., from a database.
        // We're returning a static user for simplicity.
        return new User("John Doe");
    }
}
?>
```

`UserFetcher` fetches a `User`. In a real application, this might involve querying a database.

4. `SecureUserFetcherProxy.php` - This is our proxy class. It implements `UserFetcherInterface` and it's used to add an extra layer of security before fetching the user data.

```php
<?php
// SecureUserFetcherProxy.php
require_once 'UserFetcherInterface.php';
require_once 'UserFetcher.php';

class SecureUserFetcherProxy implements UserFetcherInterface {
    private UserFetcher $fetcher;
    private string $secretToken;

    public function __construct(string $secretToken) {
        $this->fetcher = new UserFetcher();
        $this->secretToken = $secretToken;
    }

    public function fetchUser(): User {
        if ($this->secretToken !== "SecretToken123") {
            throw new Exception("Invalid token; access denied!");
        }
        return $this->fetcher->fetchUser();
    }
}
?>
```

`SecureUserFetcherProxy` checks a "secret token" before allowing the user data to be fetched. This is a simple form of authentication.

5. `index.php` - This will be our main file to run the application.

```php
<?php
// index.php
require_once 'SecureUserFetcherProxy.php';

try {
    $secretToken = "SecretToken123"; // Try changing this to an incorrect token to test the security.
    $proxy = new SecureUserFetcherProxy($secretToken);
    $user = $proxy->fetchUser();
    echo "User fetched: " . $user->getName();
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage(); // In a real application, you might want to handle exceptions differently.
}
?>
```

In `index.php`, we're creating a new `SecureUserFetcherProxy` with a "secret token." If the token is correct, we fetch and display the user's name. If the token is wrong, an exception is thrown.

When you run `index.php` on a server, you should see in the browser:
```
User fetched: John Doe
```

If you change the `$secretToken` to something other than `"SecretToken123"` in `index.php`, you should see:
```
Invalid token; access denied!
```

This demonstrates the Proxy pattern in action: `SecureUserFetcherProxy` is controlling access to `UserFetcher`, adding an additional layer of security.

Regarding the order of creating classes:
1. `User.php` - as it's the base entity we are working with.
2. `UserFetcherInterface.php` - it defines the contract for our fetchers.
3. `UserFetcher.php` - implements the actual fetching logic.
4. `SecureUserFetcherProxy.php` - adds the security layer.
5. `index.php` - the driver script to test our logic.

This ensures that we are building on top of base entities and abstractions, moving towards higher-level logic.
