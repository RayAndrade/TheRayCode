### Proxy Design Pattern:
The Proxy Design Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This is useful in various scenarios, such as:
1. **Remote Proxy**: Represents an object in a different address space.
2. **Virtual Proxy**: Creates expensive objects on demand.
3. **Protection Proxy**: Controls access to the original object.
