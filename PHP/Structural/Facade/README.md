**Facade Design Pattern**:
The Facade Design Pattern is a structural pattern that presents a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. In essence, it provides a high-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by masking its complexities.

Key roles in the Facade pattern are:
1. **Facade**: This class provides a simplified interface to the complex subsystem, ensuring that clients need to interact only with this interface and not the intricate details of the subsystem.
2. **Subsystem Classes**: These are the underlying components that offer the actual functionalities but might have complex or unstructured interactions.

**Why PHP Programmers Should Study the Facade Design Pattern**:
1. **Simplicity**: PHP, given its dynamic nature, is often used in web development projects with varied complexities. The Facade pattern helps streamline these complexities, offering a more straightforward approach to developers.

2. **Clean Code**: Interacting with a complex subsystem directly can lead to cluttered and hard-to-maintain code. The Facade pattern ensures that there's a single point of interaction, leading to cleaner, more readable PHP code.

3. **Consistent Integration**: PHP applications frequently communicate with various services like databases, caching systems, or third-party APIs. Using the Facade pattern can create a consistent interface to these varied services, easing the integration process.

4. **Flexibility**: If there's ever a need to change the underlying subsystem (like switching from one service provider to another), having a facade in place ensures that the bulk of the application remains unaffected, promoting flexibility and scalability.

5. **Encapsulation**: The Facade pattern encapsulates the complexities of the subsystem. This encapsulation ensures that any changes in the subsystem do not affect its consumers, making the system more robust.

6. **Improved Testing**: With the Facade pattern, testing becomes more straightforward. The clear interface provided by the facade can be easily mocked, allowing for isolated and focused unit tests.

7. **Framework Development**: For PHP developers creating or working with frameworks, the Facade pattern is commonly used to offer users of the framework a simplified and intuitive interface, hiding the underlying complexities.

8. **Efficiency in Development**: By reducing the complexity of interactions, developers can achieve faster and more efficient development cycles, crucial in agile or fast-paced development environments.

In conclusion, the Facade Design Pattern is crucial for PHP developers aiming to build scalable and maintainable applications. Given PHP's dominant role in web development and the myriad of services a typical PHP application interacts with, mastering the Facade pattern becomes essential for developing coherent, efficient, and robust systems.
