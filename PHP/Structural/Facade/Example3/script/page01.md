The Facade design pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 

It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

Let's use a simple example to demonstrate the Facade pattern. 

Let's say we have a subsystem for a home theater with classes for **Projector**, **DVDPlayer**, and **Amplifier**. 

Instead of controlling each of these components separately, we can use the **HomeTheaterFacade** to provide a simplified interface.
