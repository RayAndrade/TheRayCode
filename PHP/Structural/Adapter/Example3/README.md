Certainly! The Adapter Design Pattern concept can be likened to a physical adapter used in the electrical domain. Let's illustrate this with a common scenario: converting a 3-prong plug to fit into a 2-prong outlet with ground.

### Scenario

Imagine you've got an appliance with a 3-prong plug, but the wall outlet available is only a 2-prong one with a ground. If you try to plug it in directly, it won't fit. This is where an electrical adapter comes in handy. You plug the 3-prong plug into the adapter and then plug the adapter into the 2-prong outlet with ground.

### Code Representation

1. **ApplianceInterface.php**:
   This represents any electrical device we want to plug into the outlet.

```php
interface ApplianceInterface
{
    public function connect();
}
```

2. **ThreeProngAppliance.php**:
   This is our electrical device that has a 3-prong plug.

```php
class ThreeProngAppliance implements ApplianceInterface
{
    public function connect()
    {
        echo "Connected using a 3-prong plug.\n";
    }
}
```

3. **TwoProngOutletWithGround.php**:
   This is our desired interface, i.e., the 2-prong outlet with a ground.

```php
interface TwoProngOutletWithGround
{
    public function plugIntoTwoProngWithGround();
}
```

4. **AdapterForThreeProng.php**:
   This is our adapter. It will make the `ThreeProngAppliance` compatible with the `TwoProngOutletWithGround`.

```php
class AdapterForThreeProng implements TwoProngOutletWithGround
{
    private $appliance;

    public function __construct(ApplianceInterface $appliance)
    {
        $this->appliance = $appliance;
    }

    public function plugIntoTwoProngWithGround()
    {
        // Here, the adapter is making the necessary changes to make the three-prong plug fit into the two-prong outlet with ground.
        echo "Adapting 3-prong plug to fit into a 2-prong outlet with ground...\n";
        $this->appliance->connect();
    }
}
```

5. **Usage.php**:
   Here's how you'd use the adapter to connect the appliance to the wall outlet.

```php
$appliance = new ThreeProngAppliance();
$adapter = new AdapterForThreeProng($appliance);
$adapter->plugIntoTwoProngWithGround(); // Output: Adapting 3-prong plug to fit into a 2-prong outlet with ground... Connected using a 3-prong plug.
```

### Explanation

Just like the physical adapter adapts the 3-prong plug to fit into a 2-prong outlet with ground, the `AdapterForThreeProng` class allows the `ThreeProngAppliance` to be connected to a `TwoProngOutletWithGround`. The client code can now use the same `plugIntoTwoProngWithGround()` method, irrespective of the appliance's original plug design, thanks to the adapter.
