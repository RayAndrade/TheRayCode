The Template Method Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in a method, but delays some steps to subclasses. It lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

### Structure
The Template Method Pattern involves:

1. **Abstract Class**: This class contains the template method and defines the skeleton of an algorithm. Some steps of the algorithm are implemented directly in the abstract class, while others are declared but not defined, leaving the concrete subclasses to provide the specific implementation.

2. **Concrete Class**: This class extends the abstract class and implements the unfulfilled operations from the abstract class.

### Why PHP developers should study the Template Method Pattern:

1. **Code Reusability**: The Template Method Pattern promotes code reusability by capturing the common logic and steps in a single location (the abstract class) and allowing the variant parts to be defined by individual subclasses.

2. **Consistent Structure**: By defining the steps of an algorithm at a high level in the abstract class, you can ensure that the structure of the algorithm remains consistent, even if the details of individual steps change.

3. **Flexibility**: While maintaining the overall structure, this pattern provides flexibility by allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps.

4. **Extension without Modification**: New variations of the algorithm can be introduced by creating new subclasses without needing to modify the existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

5. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The common logic is separated from the specifics. This provides clarity in code structure and makes it easier to understand the flow of the algorithm.

6. **Controlled Points of Extension**: By defining specific methods that subclasses should implement, you're providing controlled points of extension, which can be a good way to enforce certain standards or conventions in derived implementations.

For PHP developers, understanding the Template Method Pattern can be especially beneficial when building web applications or frameworks, where certain processes follow a standard flow but have customizable steps. For instance, when building a web framework, the general flow of handling a request and sending a response can be outlined in the abstract class, while specific processes like rendering views or handling authentication can be delegated to subclasses.

However, developers should be wary of overusing this pattern as it can lead to overly complex inheritance structures if used indiscriminately. It's essential to apply the pattern judiciously and in situations where its benefits are clearly evident.
