Running the Code

When you run index.php, you should see the titles of the books printed one after the other:
```
1984
To Kill a Mockingbird
The Great Gatsby
```
This output demonstrates the Iterator pattern in action, allowing you to sequentially access elements of the BookList without exposing its internal structure.
