We start with the **Phrase** class

This class **will be a** *part* of the main class we desire to clone..

The Phrase class is straightforward. 

It's a simple class with a phrase type property.

```
Phrase
```


```
public $phrase;

public function __construct($phrase) {
    $this->phrase = $phrase;
}
```
