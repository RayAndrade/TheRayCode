This code provides an implementation of the Strategy design pattern in PHP. 

The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. 

It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Create **interface**
```
Strategy
```

with
```
public function doAlgorithm(array $data): array;
```
