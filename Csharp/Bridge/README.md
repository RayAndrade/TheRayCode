## Builder cpp

Unlike other creational patterns, Builder doesnâ€™t require products to have a common interface. 
That makes it possible to produce different products using the same construction process.
The Builder pattern can be recognized in a class, which has a single creation method and several methods to configure the resulting object. 



The Ray code is AWESOME!!!
