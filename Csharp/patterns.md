### **Creational Patterns in C#**  
Creational patterns in C# focus on efficient object creation while reducing coupling and promoting flexibility in design.

1. **Singleton**  
Ensures a class has a single instance, using private constructors and static properties for controlled access.

2. **Factory Method**  
Defines an interface for object creation, letting subclasses specify the type of objects to instantiate.

3. **Abstract Factory**  
Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete implementations.

4. **Builder**  
Separates complex object construction from representation, enabling flexible configurations through method chaining in C#.

5. **Prototype**  
Creates new objects by cloning existing ones, utilizing `ICloneable` and deep-copy techniques for duplicating complex objects.

### **Structural Patterns in C#**  
Structural patterns emphasize efficient class and object composition, ensuring modular, extensible, and scalable designs in C#.

6. **Adapter**  
Converts one interface to another using inheritance or composition, allowing seamless integration of incompatible components.

7. **Bridge**  
Decouples abstraction from implementation, enabling independent evolution of both through interfaces and composition in C#.

8. **Composite**  
Organizes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, leveraging recursive relationships for complex systems.

9. **Decorator**  
Adds responsibilities dynamically to objects without altering their structure, implemented with composition and interfaces.

10. **Facade**  
Provides a simplified interface to complex subsystems, encapsulating their functionality into a single, cohesive API.

11. **Flyweight**  
Minimizes memory usage by sharing common state among similar objects, often implemented with static caching in C#.

12. **Proxy**  
Acts as a placeholder or surrogate, controlling access to another object using lazy loading or remote proxies.

### **Behavioral Patterns in C#**  
Behavioral patterns in C# manage object communication and workflows, promoting dynamic, loosely-coupled systems.

13. **Chain of Responsibility**  
Passes requests through a chain of handlers, allowing each to decide whether to process or forward the request.

14. **Command**  
Encapsulates requests as objects, enabling flexible execution, queuing, and undo/redo operations in C#.

15. **Interpreter**  
Defines and evaluates a grammar for a language, suitable for scripting engines and domain-specific languages.

16. **Iterator**  
Provides a standard way to traverse collections, leveraging `IEnumerable` and `IEnumerator` for seamless iteration.

17. **Mediator**  
Centralizes communication between objects, reducing dependencies by using events, delegates, or a mediator class.

18. **Memento**  
Captures and restores an object’s internal state without exposing implementation details, useful for undo functionality.

19. **Observer**  
Establishes a one-to-many relationship where changes in one object notify dependents, using events or delegates.

20. **State**  
Changes an object’s behavior based on its state, modeled using polymorphism or a state pattern implementation.

21. **Strategy**  
Encapsulates algorithms within classes, allowing dynamic substitution of strategies for tasks like validation or sorting.

22. **Template Method**  
Defines an algorithm’s skeleton in a base class, allowing subclasses to override specific steps while retaining structure.

23. **Visitor**  
Encapsulates operations to be performed on object structures, enabling new functionality without altering the objects.
