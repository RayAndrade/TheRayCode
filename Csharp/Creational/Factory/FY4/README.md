## Factory Design Pattern using c#

The Factory Method pattern is widely used in C# code. Itâ€™s very useful when you need to provide a high level of flexibility for your code.

For our example of the **Factory** pattern we will create an interface we call **Product**.cs. 
The Product interface declares the operations that all concrete products must implement.
This interface will require one method. The code for **Product** looks as the following:
```c#
public interface Product
{
   string Operation();
}
```
Next we will create a couple of *concrete products* to add them to our project. 
The name of these products will be **ProductA** and **ProductB**.
The Concrete Products will provide various implementations of the Product interface
The code for **ProductA** will be:
```c#
class ProductA : Product
{
   public string Operation()
   {
      return "{From of ProductA}";
   }
}
```
And for the *concrete product* **ProductB** we have:
```c#
class ProductB : Product
{
   public string Operation()
   {
     return "{From of ProductB}";
   }
}
```
The client code works with an instance of the concrete creator, even through it is the base interface. 
As long as the client keeps working with the creator via this base interface, you can pass it any creator's subclass to it.

Concrete Creators override the factory method in order to change the resulting product's type.
 
Now let's focus on the abstract class we call **Creator**.

The Creator class declares the factory method that is returns an object of a Product class. The Creator's subclasses usually provide the implementation of thie factory method.

Note also despite its name, the Creator's primary responsibility is not creating products. 
Usually, it will contain some core business logic that relies on the Product objects, returned by the factory method. 
Subclasses can indirectly change that business logic by overriding the factory method and returning a different type of product from it.


It look's like:
```c#
abstract class Creator
{
   public abstract Product FactoryMethod();
   public string SomeOperation()
   {
      var product = FactoryMethod();
      var result = "Creator: This creator's code has just worked with "
                  + product.Operation();
      return result;
   }
}
```
Notice that the **Creator** also provides some default implementation of the factory method.
Also note that, despite its name, the Creator's primary responsibility is not creating products. 
Usually, it contains some core business logic that relies on Product objects, returned by the factory method. 
Subclasses can indirectly change that business logic by overriding the factory method and returning a different type of product from it.

Subclasses can indirectly change the business logic by overriding the factory and returning a different type.
We add an abstract Product we call **FactoryMethod**.
We then add **SomeOperation** to the progect class. 

We now create a couple of *abstract class*.
Let's create these classes **CreatorX** and **CreatorZ**.
We start with **CreatorX**. This class returns a *new* **ProductA**.
Let's look at the code:
```c#
class CreatorX : Creator
{
   public override Product FactoryMethod()
   {
      return new ProductA();
   }
}
```

Note that the signature of the method still uses the abstract product type, even though the concrete product is actually returned from the method. 
This way the Creator can stay independent of concrete product classes.
likewise, the code for **CreatorZ** will be like: 

```c#
class CreatorZ : Creator
{
   public override Product FactoryMethod()
   {
      return new ProductB();
   }
}
```

Let's create a **Director** class that will run the **Builder** class object.
The code for this class will be:
```c#
 public class Director
 {
    private Builder _builder;
    
    public Builder Builder
    {
       set { _builder = value; } 
    }
       
    // The Director can construct several product variations using the same
    // building steps.
    public void buildMinimalViableProduct()
    {
       this._builder.BuildPartA();
    }
        
    public void buildFullFeaturedProduct()
    {
      this._builder.BuildPartA();
      this._builder.BuildPartB();
      this._builder.BuildPartC();
    }
 }
```

Now let's put this all together in the **Client**.cs class.

```c#
class Client
{
    public void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("App: Launched with the CreatorX.");
        ClientCode(new CreatorX());
           
        Console.WriteLine("");
        Console.WriteLine("App: Launched with the CreatorZ.");
        ClientCode(new CreatorZ());
    }
    public void ClientCode(Creator creator)
    {
        // ...
        Console.WriteLine("Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class," +
                          "but it still works.\n" + creator.SomeOperation());
        // ...
    }
}
```

and now let's run our work in the **Program**.cs class. 
We create the following code:

```c#
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        new Client().Main();
    }
}
```
We are ready to run our program and thus we have:

```
App: Launched with the CreatorX.
Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class,but it still works.
Creator: This creator's code has just worked with {From of ProductA}

App: Launched with the CreatorZ.
Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class,but it still works.
Creator: This creator's code has just worked with {From of ProductB}
```

Be good and happy programming
