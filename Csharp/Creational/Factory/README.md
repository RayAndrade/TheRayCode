**C# Factory Design Pattern**

|Pattern|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Factory** | [**C++**](../../../CPP/Creational/Builder/README.md) | [**C#**](../../../Csharp/Creational/Builder/README.md) | [Java](../../../Java/Creational/Builder/README.md) | [PHP](../../../PHP/Creational/Builder/README.md) |

The **Factory design** pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In other words, it defines a way to create objects without specifying their exact class.

For this example, let's create a toy factory that produces different types of toys, such as dolls, cars, and trains. We will use C# to implement this example.

First, let's create an interface for the toys that the factory will produce. We will call this interface "IToy".

IToy will force the reqiierment for **void Play()**;
