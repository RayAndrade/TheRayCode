The factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In other words, it defines a way to create objects without specifying their exact class.

For this example, let's create a toy factory that produces different types of toys, such as dolls, cars, and trains. We will use C# to implement this example.

First, let's create an interface for the toys that the factory will produce. We will call this interface "IToy".
