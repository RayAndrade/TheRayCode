Finally, let's create a program that uses the toy factory to create and play with toys.

the Program class is responsible for using the ToyFactory to create and play with toys. It demonstrates how the factory pattern can be used to create objects without knowing their exact type.


In this example, we created an interface for the toys, implemented classes for each type of toy, created a factory class that creates the toys based on a string input, and finally created a program that uses the factory to create and play with toys.

Note that each class is in its own separate file and organized by namespace. The dependency is organized by making sure that each class has the proper namespace and is referenced properly in the other classes that use it.

Overall, the responsibility of each class is clearly defined and well-separated, making the code easy to read and maintain.
