Creating an example of the Abstract Factory design pattern in C# involves multiple steps. 

The Abstract Factory pattern is used to provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### 1. Abstract Product Classes
First, define abstract product classes. These represent different types of products that can be created by the factories.

#### `IProductA.cs`
Create interface
```
IProductA
```
with
```
string FunctionA();
```
