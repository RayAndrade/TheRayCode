**C# Builder Design Pattern**

The **Builder pattern** is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. 

It separates the construction of an object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. 

It's particularly useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.

**Separation of concerns**: The Builder design pattern separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing you to focus on different aspects independently.

**Encapsulation**: It encapsulates the construction logic within the Builder class, providing a clean and organized way to create complex objects.

**Readability and maintainability**: By using the Builder pattern, you can improve the readability and maintainability of your code by making the construction process explicit and easy to understand.

**Flexibility**: The Builder pattern allows you to vary the internal representation of an object being constructed, giving you the flexibility to create different configurations without modifying the client code.

**Encourages fluent interface**: The Builder pattern often promotes the use of a fluent interface, enabling a more expressive and readable way of constructing objects.

**Encourages SOLID principles**: The Builder pattern aligns with SOLID principles, such as Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Open/Closed Principle (OCP), by separating object construction and allowing for extension without modification.

**Participants of the UML**

**Builder** specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a **Product** object

**ConcreteBuilder** constructs and assembles parts of the product by implementing the **Builder** interface.

Defines and keeps track of the representation it creates

Provides an interfase for retrieving the product

**Director** constructs an objectusing the **Builder** interface.

**Product** reoresents the complex object under construction.
