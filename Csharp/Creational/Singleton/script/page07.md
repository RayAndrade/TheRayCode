Output:
```
Singleton says: Hello, World!
Singleton says: Hello again!
The instances are the same!
```

In the `Main` method, we try to get two instances of the `Singleton` class, but since it's implemented as a singleton, both variables refer to the same object. 
The program demonstrates this by calling methods on both instances and showing that they are the same.
