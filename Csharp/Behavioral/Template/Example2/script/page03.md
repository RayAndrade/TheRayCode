To implement the Template design pattern in C#, we'll create several classes:

**AbstractClass**: This class defines abstract methods that will be implemented by concrete subclasses. It also provides a template method that defines the skeleton of the algorithm.

**ConcreteClass1 and ConcreteClass2**: These are subclasses of AbstractClass. They implement the abstract methods defined in AbstractClass.

**Program**: This class contains the Main method where we'll demonstrate the usage of our Template design pattern implementation.
