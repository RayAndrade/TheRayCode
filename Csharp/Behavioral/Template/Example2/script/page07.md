### Expected Output When Running the Program
When you run the `Program.cs`, you should expect the following output:

```
Testing ConcreteClassA:
BaseOperation: Common operation for all subclasses
ConcreteClassA: Implemented RequiredOperations1
ConcreteClassA: Implemented RequiredOperation2
ConcreteClassA: Overridden Hook1

Testing ConcreteClassB:
BaseOperation: Common operation for all subclasses
ConcreteClassB: Implemented RequiredOperations1
ConcreteClassB: Implemented RequiredOperation2
```

This example provides a clear demonstration of how the Template design pattern allows for the algorithm's structure to remain unchanged while the specific steps can vary between different subclasses.
