An observer design pattern can be used to create a one-to-many relationship of objects AND this relationship should be such that when one object *changes* then ALL
tother connected objects get notified.

In this video snippided I will review the Obserserver as outlined by the gang of four using C#.


The basic idea in implementing this design pattern is that when an observer is created, it registers itself with an object which is called the subject.
