This C# code demonstrates the Chain of Responsibility design pattern. Let's break down each file and the roles of the classes and variables:

### 1. Animal.cs
This is an abstract class that represents a generic animal. It contains:
- `protected Animal NextAnimal;`: A field that holds a reference to the next `Animal` object in the chain.
- `public void SetNext(Animal next) { ... }`: A method to set the `NextAnimal` field. This links one animal to the next in the chain.
- `public abstract void PerformAct(string trick);`: An abstract method that each specific animal class will implement. It defines the action an animal performs.

**Animal.cs**
```
namespace Show
{
    public abstract class Animal
    {
        protected Animal NextAnimal;

        public void SetNext(Animal next)
        {
            NextAnimal = next;
        }

        public abstract void PerformAct(string trick);

    }
}
```


### 2. SingingChicken.cs
This class extends `Animal` and represents a chicken that can sing:
- `public override void PerformAct(string trick) { ... }`: Overrides `PerformAct`. If the `trick` is "sing", the chicken performs. Otherwise, it passes the request to the next animal in the chain.


**SingingChicken.cs**
```
using System;

namespace Show
{
    public class SingingChicken: Animal
    {
        public override void PerformAct(string trick)
        {
            if (trick == "sing")
            {
                Console.WriteLine("🐔 Chicken grabs the mic and clucks a lovely tune!");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("🐔 Chicken forgot the lyrics! Passing the mic...");
                NextAnimal?.PerformAct(trick);
            }
        }
  
    }
}
```


### 3. JugglingPig.cs
This class extends `Animal` and represents a pig that can juggle:
- `public override void PerformAct(string trick) { ... }`: Similar to `SingingChicken`, but for "juggle". If the `trick` is not "juggle", it passes the request to the next animal.

**JugglingPig.cs**
```
using System;

namespace Show
{
    public class JugglingPig: Animal
    {
        public override void PerformAct(string trick)
        {
            if (trick == "juggle")
            {
                Console.WriteLine("🐖 Pig juggles apples, but eats one midway! Classic Pig!");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("🐖 Pig's hooves are too slippery today! Passing the mic...");
                NextAnimal?.PerformAct(trick);
            }
        }

    }
}
```
### 4. DancingLlama.cs
This class also extends `Animal` and represents a llama that can dance:
- `public override void PerformAct(string trick) { ... }`: Implements the method but doesn't check the `trick` type, and always performs its act (dancing).


This code is a good example of the Chain of Responsibility pattern, where a request (performing a trick) travels along a chain of handlers (animals) until one of them handles it.




**DancingLlama.cs**
```
using System;

namespace Show
{
    public class DancingLlama: Animal
    {
        public override void PerformAct(string trick)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"🦙 Llama does the moonwalk, then breakdances. Crowd goes wild!");
        }
    }
}
```
### 5. Program.cs
This is the main entry point of the application. It sets up the chain and tests it:
- Creates instances of `SingingChicken`, `JugglingPig`, and `DancingLlama`.
- Links them in a chain: chicken -> pig -> llama.
- Tries to make them perform different acts.



**Program.cs**
```
using System;

namespace Show
{
    internal class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var chicken = new SingingChicken();
            var pig = new JugglingPig();
            var llama = new DancingLlama();

            chicken.SetNext(pig);
            pig.SetNext(llama);

            Console.WriteLine("The talent show begins! Chicken's turn:\n");
            chicken.PerformAct("dance");

            Console.WriteLine("\nNow, Pig takes the stage:\n");
            chicken.PerformAct("juggle");

            Console.WriteLine("\nAlright, Llama! Show them what you got:\n");
            chicken.PerformAct("dance");

        }
    }
}
```
### Execution and Output
When the code is compiled and run, the following occurs:
1. The chicken is asked to "dance". Since it can't, it passes the request to the pig.
2. The pig is asked to "juggle". Since it's a juggling pig, it performs the act.
3. The chicken is again asked to "dance". It again passes the request, this time to the pig, who then passes it to the llama. The llama performs the dance.

The output will be:
```
The talent show begins! Chicken's turn:

🐔 Chicken forgot the lyrics! Passing the mic...
🐖 Pig's hooves are too slippery today! Passing the mic...
🦙 Llama does the moonwalk, then breakdances. Crowd goes wild!

Now, Pig takes the stage:

🐖 Pig juggles apples, but eats one midway! Classic Pig!

Alright, Llama! Show them what you got:

🐔 Chicken forgot the lyrics! Passing the mic...
🐖 Pig's hooves are too slippery today! Passing the mic...
🦙 Llama does the moonwalk, then breakdances. Crowd goes wild!
```
