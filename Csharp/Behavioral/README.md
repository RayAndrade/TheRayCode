Structural design patterns are design patterns that are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They help to simplify the structure of code by reducing the complexity of object interactions. As a junior C# programmer, you should be familiar with the following structural design patterns:

1. [Adapter](./Adapter/README.md) Pattern: This pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by creating an intermediary adapter object that converts the interface of one object so that it can be used by another. In C#, this can be achieved through interface implementation and inheritance.

2. [Bridge](./Bridge/README.md) Pattern: This pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. This allows for more flexible and extensible designs. In C#, this can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

3. [Composite](./Composite/README.md) Pattern: This pattern allows you to treat a group of objects as a single object by creating a tree-like structure of objects. This makes it easy to add and remove objects from the structure. In C#, this can be achieved through inheritance and interfaces.

4. [Decorator](./Decorator/README.md) Pattern: This pattern allows you to add behavior to an individual object, without affecting other objects in the same class. This is useful when you want to add new functionality to an existing class. In C#, this can be achieved through inheritance and interfaces.

5. [Facade](./Facade/README.md) Pattern: This pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system. It encapsulates a group of classes and provides a simple interface to access their functionality. In C#, this can be achieved through classes and methods.

6. [Flyweight](./Flyweight/README.md) Pattern: This pattern reduces the memory footprint of a large number of similar objects by sharing common data among them. In C#, this can be achieved through object pooling and caching.

7. [Proxy](./Proxy/README.md) Pattern: This pattern provides a placeholder for an object to control access to it. It can be used to implement security checks, caching, or other types of optimizations. In C#, this can be achieved through interfaces and classes.

Understanding these design patterns can help you write more efficient and maintainable code in C#. You can start by reading about each pattern and understanding its purpose, advantages, and limitations. Additionally, there are many open-source projects that make use of these design patterns, so studying these projects can provide practical examples of how to implement these patterns in real-world scenarios.
