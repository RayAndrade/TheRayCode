The **Prototype** design pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create copies of objects without specifying their concrete classes. 
It provides a way to create new objects by **cloning** an existing object, rather than creating them from scratch. 
This pattern is useful when creating new objects is costly or complex.

To demonstrate the **Prototype** pattern with **deep copy** and **shallow copy** in C#, 
let's consider an example of a **Person** class that has a **name** and an **Address object**. 
We'll create copies of the **Person** object using both shallow and deep copy techniques.

First, let's define the **Address** class:

```
public class Address
{
    public string Street { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }

    public Address(string street, string city)
    {
        Street = street;
        City = city;
    }
}
```

Next, we'll define the **Person** class that contains the **Address** object:
```
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Address Address { get; set; }

    public Person(string name, Address address)
    {
        Name = name;
        Address = address;
    }

    public Person ShallowCopy()
    {
        return (Person)this.MemberwiseClone();
    }

    public Person DeepCopy()
    {
        Address clonedAddress = new Address(Address.Street, Address.City);
        return new Person(Name, clonedAddress);
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"Name: {Name}, Address: {Address.Street}, {Address.City}";
    }
}
```
In the **Person** class, we've added two methods: **ShallowCopy()** and **DeepCopy()**. 
The **ShallowCopy()** method uses the **MemberwiseClone()** method to create a shallow copy of the Person object. 
The **DeepCopy()** method creates a **new Person** object and also creates a **new Address** object to achieve a deep copy.

Now, let's demonstrate the difference between shallow copy and deep copy:


In the Main
```
Address address = new Address("123 Main St", "Cityville");
Person person1 = new Person("John", address);

        // Shallow copy
Person person2 = person1.ShallowCopy();
person2.Name = "Jane";
person2.Address.City = "Townsville";

        // Deep copy
Person person3 = person1.DeepCopy();
person3.Name = "Mike";
person3.Address.City = "Villageville";

Console.WriteLine(person1);  // Output: Name: John, Address: 123 Main St, Villageville
Console.WriteLine(person2);  // Output: Name: Jane, Address: 123 Main St, Townsville
Console.WriteLine(person3);  // Output: Name: Mike, Address: 123 Main St, Villageville

```

In the above example, we create a **Person** object (**person1**) with a given name and address. 
Then, we create a **shallow copy** (**person2**) and *modify* the name and the city of the **address**. 
Since the shallow copy shares the same **Address** reference, changing the **city** for **person2** *also affects* the original **person1**.

In contrast, the deep copy (person3) creates a new Address object, ensuring that modifications to the copied Address object do not affect the original or other copies.

By using the Prototype pattern, you can create copies of objects while *controlling the depth* of the copy according to your needs.
