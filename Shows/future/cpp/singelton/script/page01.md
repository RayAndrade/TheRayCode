In this example of the **Singleton** pattern in C++ with each class in its own **.h** file.

I'll also provide a Demo in the **main** method *file* named **Demo.cpp** to showcase its usage. 

I'll describe the utility of each file, 

explain when you would use the **Singleton** pattern, and demonstrate that a new Singleton instance does not create a new class by comparing the addresses. 

Finally, I'll show how a **non-Singleton** class creates a different instance by verifying their reference IDs.
