**Shape.java**:

This is an **abstract class** that serves as the base class for *all shapes in our hierarchy*.

The Shape class defines a **common interface** (draw method) that all shapes must implement. 

It provides a contract for shape objects to be drawable, ensuring consistency and polymorphic behavior across different shape types

create class:

```
Shape
```

make it **abstract**

```
abstract
```
add the abstract method  Shape **draw**

```
public abstract void draw();
```
