The **Builder Design Pattern** is a creational pattern used for constructing *complex* objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, so the same construction process can create different representations


Let's imagine a simple example of a Car object. A Car may have different components (like Engine, Wheels, Seats, etc.), and these components can vary from car to car. We could have a CarBuilder that allows the creation of Car objects in a step-by-step manner.
