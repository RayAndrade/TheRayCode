This is our Program class that contains the main method where the application begins execution. 

It creates a new DessertFactory object and uses it to create Cake and IceCream objects. 

These objects are then used to call the prepare method, and this is where polymorphism comes into play.


Remember that all classes should be in their own files, and all file names should start with a capital letter because this is the convention in Java.
