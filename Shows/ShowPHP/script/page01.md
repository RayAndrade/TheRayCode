**Prototype Design Pattern**: 
This design pattern comes under the category of *creational patterns*. 
In this pattern, we create objects by cloning a prototypical instance at runtime. 
This is useful when object initialization is costly, and you want to efficiently produce a copy of a pre-existing, initialized instance.
