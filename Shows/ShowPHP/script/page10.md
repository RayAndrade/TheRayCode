Use a **Shallow Copy**: When you want to copy an object and don't mind that the original and the copy can influence each other. 
This is often used when the object's data members are primitive types or when the object doesn't contain any members which are references to other complex objects.
    
Use a **Deep Copy**: When you want a fully independent copy of the object, including its nested objects. 
This is used when you don't want changes to the copied object to affect the original object.
