**Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy of an object is a new object which is a copy of the original object. 
The new object refers to the same memory locations as the original one. 
So changes in one object's properties will also reflect on the other. 
In the context of a PHP object, a shallow copy will not clone nested objects. 
Instead, the new and original objects will reference the same nested objects.
