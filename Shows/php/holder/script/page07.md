[home](./page01.md) | [back](./page06.md) 

When you run index.php, you should see the total size of the directory, which includes the sizes of all files in it and its subdirectories. The output will be:
```
Total Size of 'Directory': 630 bytes
```
This example demonstrates how the Composite pattern can be used to work with tree-like structures. 
Students can see how both individual files and directories (which can contain other files or directories) are treated uniformly through the FileComponent interface.
