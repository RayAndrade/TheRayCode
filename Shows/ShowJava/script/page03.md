Next we creat the Circle **class** object.

This class represents a circle and is extended by the Shape class. 

The **Circle** class inherits the draw method from the **Shape** *class* and provides its own implementation specific to drawing a circle. 

It demonstrates how different shape classes can have their own unique behavior while adhering to the common Shape interface.

create class:

```
Circle
```

```
 extends Shape
```

use the code generation and place logic

```
System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
```
