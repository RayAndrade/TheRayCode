I'll provide you with a "Chain of Responsibility" code demo in Java with a funny theme. I'll explain each class as if I'm describing it to a beginner programmer. Here's the code:

Let's imagine we're building a support system for a zoo. The animals are experiencing some funny problems, and they need our help!

We start by defining the different types of problems that animals in the zoo might experience using an enum called ProblemType.

**ProblemType** (enum): This enum is useful as it allows us to define the different types of problems that animals in the zoo might experience.

By using an enum, we can ensure type safety and easily distinguish between different problem types.

Define the problem types

create enum
```
ProblemType
```

add code 
```
HUNGER,
SLEEPINESS,
MISCHIEF
```
