Alright, if you'd like to use the name `PublicUnique` instead of `Singleton`, here's how you can implement it:

### 1. PublicUnique.java

```java
// PublicUnique.java
public class PublicUnique {
    
    // 1. Create a private static instance of the PublicUnique class. It's initialized to null initially.
    private static PublicUnique uniqueInstance;

    // 2. Private constructor prevents instantiation from other classes.
    private PublicUnique() { }

    // 3. Public method to provide access to the instance. If the instance is null, it creates a new one.
    public static PublicUnique getInstance() {
        if (uniqueInstance == null) {
            uniqueInstance = new PublicUnique();
        }
        return uniqueInstance;
    }

    // Optionally, you can have other methods in this class.
    public void showMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello from the PublicUnique class!");
    }
}
```

### 2. Main.java

```java
// Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Attempting to get the unique PublicUnique instance
        PublicUnique instance1 = PublicUnique.getInstance();
        instance1.showMessage();

        // Attempting to get the PublicUnique instance again
        PublicUnique instance2 = PublicUnique.getInstance();
        
        // Compare the two instances to check if they are the same
        if (instance1 == instance2) {
            System.out.println("Both instances are identical!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Instances are different!");
        }
    }
}
```

**Order**:
1. Start by creating `PublicUnique.java`. This class holds the logic to ensure that there is only one instance.
2. Next, create `Main.java` which demonstrates the unique instance pattern.

When executed, the `Main.java` class will show that both `instance1` and `instance2` are the same, which is the essence of the Singleton pattern, now using `PublicUnique` as the class name.
