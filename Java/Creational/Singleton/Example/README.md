The Singleton design pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point to access it.

Here's a basic outline of how you can implement the Singleton design pattern:

1. **Singleton.java**: This will contain the Singleton class.
2. **Main.java**: This will be used to demonstrate the functionality of the Singleton pattern.

Let's go step by step.

### 1. Singleton.java

```java
// Singleton.java
public class Singleton {
    
    // 1. Create a private static instance of the Singleton class. It's initialized to null initially.
    private static Singleton uniqueInstance;

    // 2. Private constructor prevents instantiation from other classes.
    private Singleton() { }

    // 3. Public method to provide access to the instance. If the instance is null, it creates a new one.
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (uniqueInstance == null) {
            uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
        }
        return uniqueInstance;
    }

    // Optionally, you can have other methods in this class.
    public void showMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello from the Singleton class!");
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `uniqueInstance` holds a reference to the single instance of `Singleton` that's created.
- The private constructor ensures that no other class can instantiate a `Singleton` using the `new` keyword.
- `getInstance()` provides global access to the Singleton instance. It's a static method, which means you can call it without creating an object.

### 2. Main.java

```java
// Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Attempting to get the unique Singleton instance
        Singleton instance1 = Singleton.getInstance();
        instance1.showMessage();

        // Attempting to get the Singleton instance again
        Singleton instance2 = Singleton.getInstance();
        
        // Compare the two instances to check if they are the same
        if (instance1 == instance2) {
            System.out.println("Both instances are identical!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Instances are different!");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- In the `Main` class, we retrieve the Singleton instance twice using `getInstance()`. 
- We then check if `instance1` and `instance2` are the same using the `==` operator. They should be identical, as that's the core concept of the Singleton pattern.

**Order**:
1. Create the `Singleton.java` class first. This will contain the primary logic for ensuring there's only one instance.
2. Create the `Main.java` class to demonstrate the Singleton pattern.

When you run `Main.java`, it will demonstrate that both `instance1` and `instance2` are identical, indicating that there's only one instance of the Singleton class.
