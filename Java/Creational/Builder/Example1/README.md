# üß± Builder Design Pattern ‚Äì Java Implementation (Gang of Four)

---

## üîç Overview

The **Builder pattern** is a *creational* design pattern that separates the **construction of a complex object** from its **representation**. This allows the same construction process to create different representations. The pattern is ideal for scenarios where an object has many optional parts or a complex construction sequence.

## ‚úÖ Class-by-Class Description (with Code)

---

### 1. `Product.java`  
**Purpose**: Represents the complex object that is being built. It contains multiple parts (`partA`, `partB`, `partC`), each assigned during the build process.  

**Key Methods**:
- `setPartA(String partA)`: Assigns content to Part A.
- `setPartB(String partB)`: Assigns content to Part B.
- `setPartC(String partC)`: Assigns content to Part C.
- `show()`: Outputs the current state of the product.

```java
public class Product {
    private String partA;
    private String partB;
    private String partC;

    public void setPartA(String partA) {
        this.partA = partA;
    }

    public void setPartB(String partB) {
        this.partB = partB;
    }

    public void setPartC(String partC) {
        this.partC = partC;
    }

    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Product Parts:");
        System.out.println("PartA: " + partA);
        System.out.println("PartB: " + partB);
        System.out.println("PartC: " + partC);
    }
}
```

---

### 2. `Builder.java`  
**Purpose**: This is an **interface** that defines the abstract steps needed to build the product. It ensures a consistent process across different builders.

**Key Methods**:
- `buildPartA()`: Specifies how to build Part A.
- `buildPartB()`: Specifies how to build Part B.
- `buildPartC()`: Specifies how to build Part C.
- `getResult()`: Returns the final assembled `Product`.

```java
public interface Builder {
    void buildPartA();
    void buildPartB();
    void buildPartC();
    Product getResult();
}
```

---

### 3. `ConcreteBuilder.java`  
**Purpose**: Implements the `Builder` interface. It contains logic to assemble the parts of the product step-by-step and maintains an internal reference to the `Product` being constructed.

**Key Methods**:
- `buildPartA()`: Builds and assigns a value to `partA` in `Product`.
- `buildPartB()`: Builds and assigns a value to `partB` in `Product`.
- `buildPartC()`: Builds and assigns a value to `partC` in `Product`.
- `getResult()`: Returns the fully constructed `Product`.

```java
public class ConcreteBuilder implements Builder {
    private Product product = new Product();

    @Override
    public void buildPartA() {
        product.setPartA("PartA built by ConcreteBuilder");
    }

    @Override
    public void buildPartB() {
        product.setPartB("PartB built by ConcreteBuilder");
    }

    @Override
    public void buildPartC() {
        product.setPartC("PartC built by ConcreteBuilder");
    }

    @Override
    public Product getResult() {
        return product;
    }
}
```

---

### 4. `Director.java`  
**Purpose**: The `Director` class defines the **order in which the building steps are executed**. It uses a `Builder` to perform the steps and produce a `Product`.

**Key Methods**:
- `construct()`: Calls `buildPartA()`, `buildPartB()`, and `buildPartC()` on the builder to assemble the product.

```java
public class Director {
    private Builder builder;

    public Director(Builder builder) {
        this.builder = builder;
    }

    public void construct() {
        builder.buildPartA();
        builder.buildPartB();
        builder.buildPartC();
    }
}
```

---

### 5. `index.java`  
**Purpose**: This is the **client** class. It demonstrates how to use the `Builder`, `Director`, and `Product` to create a complete object.

**Key Steps**:
- Create a `ConcreteBuilder` object.
- Assign it to a `Director`.
- Use the director‚Äôs `construct()` method to build the object.
- Retrieve the finished product via `getResult()`.
- Display the product via `show()`.

```java
public class index {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Builder builder = new ConcreteBuilder();
        Director director = new Director(builder);
        director.construct();
        Product product = builder.getResult();
        product.show();
    }
}
```
When we compile and run we get:
```
Product Parts:
PartA: PartA built by ConcreteBuilder
PartB: PartB built by ConcreteBuilder
PartC: PartC built by ConcreteBuilder
```

## üì¶ Final Notes

- Each class should be saved in its **own `.java` file**.
- Make sure all `.java` files are in the **same directory** for easy compilation.
- To compile and run:
```bash
javac *.java
java index
```
