What is the Abstract Factory pattern?

It is like a factory, but everything is encapsulated
* The method that orders the object
* The factories that build the objects
* The final objects
* Composition: Objects class fields are objects.

What can you do with an Abstract Factory?

* Allows you to create families of related objects without specifying a concrete class
* Use when your have many objects that can be added, or changed dynamically during runtime.
* You can model anything you can imagine and have those objects intereact though common interfaces.
* The Bad: Things can get comlicated.
