I'll provide an example of a prototype pattern implementation in Java using deep and shallow cloning. 

The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows cloning objects without making the code dependent on their concrete classes.

In this example, we'll create a Person class as the prototype. We'll then demonstrate both deep and shallow cloning in the main method to illustrate the difference between them.
