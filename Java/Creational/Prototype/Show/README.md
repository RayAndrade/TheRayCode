Sure, I'll provide an example of a prototype pattern implementation in Java using deep and shallow cloning. The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows cloning objects without making the code dependent on their concrete classes.

In this example, we'll create a `Person` class as the prototype. We'll then demonstrate both deep and shallow cloning in the `main` method to illustrate the difference between them.

1. `Person` class: This class represents a person with a name and an `Address` object.

```java
// Person.java
public class Person implements Cloneable {
    private String name;
    private Address address;

    public Person(String name, Address address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public Address getAddress() {
        return address;
    }

    public void setAddress(Address address) {
        this.address = address;
    }

    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone();
    }
}
```

2. `Address` class: This class represents a simple address with a city and a state.

```java
// Address.java
public class Address {
    private String city;
    private String state;

    public Address(String city, String state) {
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
    }

    public String getCity() {
        return city;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }
}
```

3. `Main` class: This class contains the `main` method to demonstrate deep and shallow cloning.

```java
// Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create an original person
            Address originalAddress = new Address("New York", "NY");
            Person originalPerson = new Person("John Doe", originalAddress);

            // Perform shallow cloning
            Person shallowClone = (Person) originalPerson.clone();
            // Change the address of the shallow clone
            shallowClone.getAddress().setCity("Los Angeles");

            // Perform deep cloning using a custom method
            Person deepClone = deepClonePerson(originalPerson);
            // Change the address of the deep clone
            deepClone.getAddress().setCity("Chicago");

            // Print the original person and its shallow clone
            System.out.println("Original Person: " + originalPerson.getName()
                    + " lives in " + originalPerson.getAddress().getCity());

            System.out.println("Shallow Clone: " + shallowClone.getName()
                    + " lives in " + shallowClone.getAddress().getCity());

            // Print the deep clone
            System.out.println("Deep Clone: " + deepClone.getName()
                    + " lives in " + deepClone.getAddress().getCity());

        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private static Person deepClonePerson(Person originalPerson) {
        try {
            // Perform deep cloning manually by creating new objects for each field
            Address originalAddress = originalPerson.getAddress();
            Address clonedAddress = new Address(originalAddress.getCity(), originalAddress.getState());
            return new Person(originalPerson.getName(), clonedAddress);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```

In the `Main` class, we create an original `Person` object with a specific `Address`. We then perform both shallow and deep cloning of this object.

- Shallow Clone: The shallow clone creates a new `Person` object but shares the same `Address` object reference as the original person. Any changes made to the `Address` object of the shallow clone will affect the original person as well.

- Deep Clone: The deep clone creates a new `Person` object along with a new `Address` object with the same values as the original person's address. This way, changes made to the `Address` object of the deep clone won't affect the original person.

By comparing the output, you'll see the difference in address between the original person, the shallow clone, and the deep clone, demonstrating the effects of shallow and deep cloning.
