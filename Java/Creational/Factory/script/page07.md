You can compile and run the Main class to see the output:

```
Drawing a circle.
Drawing a rectangle.
```
This example showcases the Factory Pattern, where the **ShapeFactory** encapsulates the object creation logic, allowing the client code to create different shape objects without directly instantiating them.

Overall, each class plays a crucial role in implementing the **Factory Pattern** and building a shape hierarchy with a central factory for object creation. 

This design allows for code reusability, scalability, and easier maintenance as new shape types can be added by simply extending the base Shape class and updating the ShapeFactory.
