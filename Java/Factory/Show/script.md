What is the Factory Pattern??<br/>
When a method returns one of several possible classe that share a common super class<br/>
<br/>
In our example we start by createing an **EnemyShip** *abstract class*<br/>

new > java class > class<br/>
name **EnemyShip**
```java
public abstract class private { }
```
we will add a couple of *private* fields we call:<br/
```java
private String name;
private double speed;
```

Let add some getters and setters for these varabls
