**Flyweight Design Pattern**:

The Flyweight Design Pattern is a structural pattern that aims to reduce memory use by sharing as much data as possible with related objects. The main idea is to minimize the number of objects by sharing data among objects so that larger numbers of objects can be efficiently supported where many objects would otherwise use up too much memory. The pattern divides an object's state into intrinsic and extrinsic states:

- **Intrinsic State**: This is the information that's shared and doesn't vary between instances. It remains constant across instances and can be stored centrally.
  
- **Extrinsic State**: This is the information that varies between instances. It cannot be shared and must be supplied by the client whenever an operation is invoked on the flyweight object.

For example, consider a word processing program. Each character in the document could be an object. Instead of having a separate object for each character instance in the document, a flyweight approach might have an object for each unique character, and the position (or other extrinsic data) for each instance would be stored separately. Thus, for a document with many repetitions of the same characters, there's significant memory savings.

**The Flyweight design pattern and why Java Programmers Should Study It**:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Java applications, especially enterprise-level or mobile applications, might need to handle a large number of objects. Managing this many objects can be a memory-intensive task. Understanding the Flyweight pattern can help developers reduce the memory footprint of their applications.

2. **Performance**: Reducing the number of objects often leads to performance improvements. By minimizing memory usage, you're also likely to experience fewer garbage collection pauses, which can boost the overall performance.

3. **Scalability**: Applications that scale to handle a large number of users or data points can benefit from the reduced memory usage. This can be particularly useful in scenarios like online gaming, real-time simulations, or any application where many similar objects are used.

4. **Complements other patterns**: Understanding Flyweight can also help in better grasping other design patterns and utilizing them in combination. For instance, it can be used in conjunction with the Composite pattern to represent complex hierarchical structures efficiently.

5. **Learning the Concept of Shared State**: Studying the Flyweight pattern makes you think deeply about the intrinsic and extrinsic states of an object, which can be a valuable thought exercise in object-oriented design.

6. **Industry Recognition**: Itâ€™s one of the patterns from the famous "Design Patterns" book by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides (commonly referred to as the Gang of Four). Being familiar with it, and other GoF patterns, is often seen as a mark of a well-rounded Java developer.

In conclusion, while the Flyweight Design Pattern might not be suitable for every application, knowing when and how to apply it can be an invaluable skill for Java programmers. It teaches important principles about memory management and efficient object representation that can be applied even beyond the direct use of the pattern.
