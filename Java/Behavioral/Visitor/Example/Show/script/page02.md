The Visitor design pattern: I'll provide a simplified example that aligns with the descriptions from the "Design Patterns" book by the Gang of Four (GoF). The Visitor pattern allows you to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying their classes. It's particularly useful for operations across a collection of different types of objects.

In this example, let's consider a document structure with two types of elements: **TextElement** and **ImageElement**. We'll implement a Visitor that can print details of these elements.
